excerpt: If you're wondering if your song should rhyme / Read this if you have time / I can show you / Just what to do / And if you don't like it you can do something else..... Yeah, that was stupid. Seriously, rhyming isn't rocket science and it works. Let me show you.

*Does my song have to rhyme?* **Of course, it does. 1. Easy. Rhyming is very easy. 2. Versatile. There are many ways to rhyme. 3. Kids vs Adults. Pick your audience. 4. Flow. Chose smooth transitions over perfect rhyme.**

## This old man, he played four.....

Pardon my silly poem earlier. I couldn't help myself. Why is rhyming so much fun? If I had to guess, I would say it is because most of us were taught the English language with rhyme.

Think about it for a minute. "Cat in the hat," "Fox in Socks," "Horton hears a who," "One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish," and that's just the Dr. Seuss stuff we all know. What about all the famous "nursery rhymes" we grew up with?

Yeah, we've all been nurse fed rhyme since before we could speak. My opinion is that is why more than **90% of all the out there music uses rhyme**. Maybe more. It just comes naturally to us.

In fact, it's so ingrained in us, that we immediately notice when a song doesn't rhyme. It's almost weird. I always feel a little dirty after listening to a song like that. I have to listen to a chorus or two of "The wheels on the bus go 'round and 'round" to set things right again.

I guess there are times when this can work, but I'm not the type to encourage you to re-invent the wheel. Pardon my pun. **Stick with what works.** Unless of course, you've found a clever way to write a song without rhyme that doesn't sound like Gregorian Chant.

## Easy peasy lemon squeezy

I can prove to you that this is simple. I'd bet that you already agree with me, but let's do a little exercise together to make the point more clear.

Come on. You can do this. **"Moses supposes his toeses are roses, but Moses supposes "erroneously". 'Cause Moses he knowes his toeses aren't roses as Moses supposes his toeses to ___"** What's the next word?

If you said, "**be**" then you are correct.

So, why did I pick this one? Because you got two different types of wordplay going on here at the same time. Not only does this use the "Oses" to tie the words together, but you also have the long vowel sound "E" at the end of each sentence.

Any word ending in with a long "E" would work in the blank. it might not make sense, but it will still rhyme. Go back and read it through again and put a few of my suggestions in. If you start having fun, add a few of your own. Here's mine:

-   **See**
-   **Spree**
-   **Tree**
-   **Wee**
-   **Pee**

Hopefully, that was a fun exercise for you. There are plenty of examples that you could use to grow your ability to rhyme. Just make sure you are working on it. **Before long rhyme will become second nature if it is not already.**

**A little bit of this and a little bit of that**

Don't get the wrong idea that all rhyme has to sound like Mother Goose or Dr. Suess. If it did, rhyme would be a pain in the caboose. Sorry, I'll try to keep my goofiness contained.

Seriously, rhyme doesn't have to be perfect. As a matter of fact, the less perfect it is, the more "mature" it will sound. That almost seems counter intuitive, I know, but it is true.

If you were to pull out your phone or CDs (if you're old enough for CDs) and listen to your favorite song, you would hear imperfect rhyme. So, what do I mean by "imperfect" rhyme?

Let's keep things simple and stay with our example from earlier. **"Moses supposes his toeses are roses, but Moses supposes "erroneously". 'Cause Moses he knowes his toeses aren't roses as Moses supposes his toeses to ___" **

I told you earlier that any word with the long vowel "E" would work in that space. So, what if I told you that would also include words that may have a consonant at the end as well? Words that sound like "be" but aren't a perfect rhyme? For example:

Try this is in place of "be":

-   **Dream**
-   **Cream**
-   **Freed**
-   **Bleed**

Do you see it? Or better yet, can you hear it? If you were singing this little rhyme to a good chord pattern, your listeners would probably not even notice the difference. Why is that?

Well, this is a whole other post in itself. Suffice it to say, when you are singing, the "vowel" sounds of your words are what is dominant in the human ear. You can test this theory next time you get to a place in a song you sing where you have trouble.

Experiment with the ending vowel sound to see if you can re-shape it so it's easier for you to hit the note. It's called by many names but I like to call this skill "**ending rhyme variation**".

This is where you re-shape/change the ending consonant or vowel sound of a word to make it sound similar to other words that may be close or not rhyme at all. This is a very common technique among vocalists. For the reasons, I stated earlier. It makes the notes easier to hit sometimes.

 **The best advice I can give when it comes to ERV** is to practice. I've included a little infographic to help you get your head around what I'm talking about if you are struggling to understand it. It's a pretty basic skill that doesn't take long to master.

## Oh, where is my hairbrush?

So, now that you've got a basic idea of how to play with your rhyme, you should be able to control how your songs sound. If you want to use more complex words, you now know how to make them work using **ERV**.

What that will allow you to do is target the audience you are writing for. Kid's songs tend to use very simple words and more perfect rhyme. If you throw a cutesy melody along with that, you should have a pretty fun kids song.

The same would be true for adults. If you insert more complex words with less perfect rhyme, your song will be more geared toward adults. If you throw a good melody and perhaps a minor key, you will have a great thought provocative song.

Determining who your audience is should really be something you do before you start writing, not afterward. Now, I know every writer works differently so that isn't a hard and fast rule. **However, I think you will be happier with the result if you follow my advice.**

## You're a smooth operator

Now it's time for you to go and practice. One thing I would strongly suggest is that you get a dictionary and a thesaurus. Expanding your vocabulary will greatly improve your rhyme skills.

As you try to fit new words and play with old ones to come up with new ideas, remember to choose a smooth transition over perfect rhyme. Your transitions will greatly rely on your syllable count.

Does that mean you have to count syllables? Yes, it does. This is such a basic part of songwriting. Every now and again I meet someone who is going to re-invent the wheel and write a "free-style" sort of song that breaks all the rules. Mostly because they are pig-headed.

If you want more on syllables read my article: [**"5 exercises that will make you awesome"**](https://mysongpro.com/posts/5-songwriting-exercises-that-will-make-you-awesome/)

What ends up happening is that they create a "Frankensong" that no one wants to listen to. What's worse is that they go into complete denial about how terrible it is. You know the type. We all run from these people because they might try to sing it to us.

Look, stick with what works. If you want to add an original twist here and there to make it your own, go for it. **Just makes sure you aren't trying to re-invent songwriting.** All the great songs you know stay true to the fundamentals of songwriting. Rhyme included.

I would encourage you not to throw the baby out with the bathwater when it comes to this skill. You can learn to rhyme in new and unique ways. If you want it to be super-complex, then try to use rhyme with words that don't rhyme.

Be creative. **Don't shrink from the challenge.** What separates the great writers from the dabblers, is tenacity. The unwillingness to give up on creating that well-crafted song. You can do this. If you couldn't, you wouldn't be reading this.

Now it's time for you to go / And it makes me sad / I have had fun with you / But I am so glad / That you are going rhyme / In your next great song.....**Now go write it!   **
