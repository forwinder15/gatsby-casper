  do. Let me show you some simple exercises that will not only help you develop
  your craft, but will have you writing better songs.

**Before we get started, I want to tell you that every songwriter works differently.** If you are looking for the "magic potion" that the rest of us seem to be hiding, you won't find it.

There's no "template" for you to plug your lyrics into and then download a perfect song. Well, maybe there is at this point with our technology, but that's not a good exercise to develop your skill as a songwriter.

Neither is practicing some of the "witchcraft" floating around these days. You can write great songs without worshiping the devil**.**Seriously, some of the suggested exercises out there are just stupid.

I don't think you need to sit in the middle of a pentagram that you painted on the floor to find your "zen". You might end up finding a demon you can't get rid of. **It's a skill, not magic.**

Is songwriting a gift from God? Absolutely. And some of us do seem to have a special knack for it, however, I can tell you that most of those "skills" are learned. We have had to work at it consistently.

If you want to win an Olympic event, you have to train non-stop. It's the same if you want to be a great songwriter. You have to work at your craft. **The more you write, the better you will get.**

What "I" am going to give you are some "practical" exercises that will help you develop skills. Skills I believe will make you a great songwriter. So without further ado, let's go.

# **Exercise 1. Counting Syllables**

This is a great way to get started in the direction of improvement. I teach this to all of my students. I've included a nifty little graphic to help you visualize what I'm going to share.

So, we have all heard the "Frankensong" I would assume. The song that sounds like it was put together by a mad man and stitched in all the wrong places? I know, that you know what I'm talking about.

The timing feels off because the syllables don't match the beat of the song. There are eight words with ten syllables jammed in a spot that was made for six words and eight syllables.

You can feel it if you try to play it or sing it. It becomes extremely obvious at the end of your verses and choruses. No matter how hard you try to speed up the words, you either "miss it" or get offbeat.

This can be maddening if you don't know how to count syllables. Refer to my graphic at this point to get an idea of what I'm describing.

![counting syllables](/images/Countingsyllables.jpg)

You see, it's not terribly difficult to do. What we have to get you in the habit of is counting syllables alongside words. **Most people with syllable issues are only counting words.**

Once you've got the idea of counting syllables in your head, we just put it to practical use. Let's take a line from a song and play with it a little to give you an idea of what it looks like.

* "I love little baby ducks, red pick-up trucks, and onions. And I love you too." = 19 syllables & 15 words

If we were trying to write a fun song that's easy to sing along with, we would do our best to match the second stanza with the one above. Let's improv a verse together.

* "I love shiny diamond rings, big expensive things, and onions. And I love you too." = 20 syllables & 15 words

That's almost an exact match. Is your mind going back to see if you can try to match them perfectly? Can you spot which word is throwing it off? I'll give you a clue, it's the only word with 3 syllables.

At this point, if you wanted an exact match and wanted to "preserve the idea" behind my verse you might find a replacement word for "expensive".

* "I love shiny diamond rings, high dollar things, and onions. And I love you too." = 19 syllables & 15 words

See what I did there? Now we have an exact match. You may have thought of a different solution that I did. That's ok. Did your solution work just as well as mine?

Yours may have worked better. That means you are getting the idea. Now, I changed the phrase "big expensive" which is a little different than picking a replacement word for "expensive".

I found it easier to replace the phrase so I could **"preserve the idea"**behind the verse. I'm going to focus on that idea in a little bit so keep reading.

I want you to get in the habit of counting out your syllables and words together. "Working out" this skill every day will make you lightning-fast at making up catchy phrases that have good rhythm.

## **Exercise 2. Rhyming the Alphabet (Ending rhyme variation)**

Ok, this exercise has gotten me a few raised eyebrows. I think if you understand the reason behind it first you'll be able to latch on to it better when I show you how.

So, the reason we want to rhyme through the alphabet is that it increases your memory of words that rhyme. **It's a pretty simple concept.**

It will also help you to develop what I call "ending rhyme variation". Now, don't let your brain fall out. "Ending rhyme variation" is simply finding different ways to rhyme words by changing the ending sounds.

Some of you will argue that this is "alliteration". I don't care what you call it as long as you grasp this concept. **It is essential to being a great songwriter.**

You can "work out" this skill by starting with a few of these basics. I only listed a few. So if you can come up more, that's great. It means you are getting the hang of it.

### **Ending Rhyme Variation:**

#### **Consonants**

* "AT" - rAT, cAT, bAT, hAT
* "BLE" - trouBLE, bubBLE, douBLE
* "ING" - troublING, bubblING, doublING

"AT", "ING", and "BLE" can help you with rhyme. Watch your syllable count.

#### **Vowels**

* "Y" in "baby" Long "E" 
* "O" in "mood" Long "U" or "Oo"
* "o" in "hot" Short "Ah"
* "o" in "love" Short "O" or "Uh"

"A,E,I,O,U‚Äù & "Ah,Aa,Eh,Ee,Uh,Oh,Oo"

Playing with words that end in different vowels will help you as well. Remember, some vowels and consonants make different vowel sounds.

This isn't very complicated. You just need to spend time practicing. Once you've got the hang of this you can start to march through the alphabet using your "ending rhyme variation".

Not only will you find different words that rhyme, but you can help the words rhyme by messing with the ending vowel sound. This is a very common practiced among vocalist to help them sing certain parts when they find a not difficult to hit or hold.

![Ending rhymes](/images/Endingrhymevariation.jpg)

Do you feel like we just broke down the English language a little? It definitely would help you to re-visit the basics of vocabulary. We touched a little on an expanded version of vowel sounds as well.

It will definitely help you to do a little bit of vocal training to understand how to re-shape or replace certain vowel sounds. **Not only will it help you sing better but it will give you another tool as a writer.**

## **Exercise 3. Preserving the idea (theme)** 

Another pitfall of the "Frankensong" is phrases that help the song rhyme but don't make any sense. A big word to describe this is contextualization.

If you watch the news you will know exactly what I am talking about. Reporters and news anchors are constantly taking things "out of context" to enhance the story for the viewers.

If you do a little investigating you find out that what was said on the news was taking out of context. It's kinda like Inigo Montoya, "I do not think it means a what you think it means."

It's the very same in your songwriting. **You have to make sure that your phrases and stanzas stay in context with one another.**

Where you will get into the biggest trouble here is with "metaphors". Sometimes we've done all we can to find a word that fits our syllable count or rhyme and we just can't find one.

So, we will turn to our metaphorical skills. This is completely fine, and in some cases will actually improve a song. However, be very careful that your metaphor makes sense with the theme of the song.

If you don't "preserve the idea" your listeners will get lost. I call this the "Black-hole song". You go in, never to return. If you do come back you've completely lost your identity.

Don't be the songwriter that loves messing with people's heads. Not if you want to have a faithful listenership of "normal" folks. If you want an occult of satanic followers "more power to you".

You will do better to stick with writing in a way that helps people. To do that, you have to have their best interest in mind.**Put yourself in your listener's shoes.**

Get down to the very base emotion that you are trying to communicate in your song. You can do this by asking yourself, "What is my song about?"

If you keep asking yourself that question, as you write your song, it will be a lot easier to stay on track. You can decide this at the beginning or in the middle just don't wait till you get completely done.

What happens if you wait till you're done is you will find your song is made up of a bunch of other song ideas. I have found that the most creative songwriter has to be the most disciplined when writing.

Once you get those juices flowing, the ideas start coming. If you aren't careful you'll have ten great ideas and no song to show for it.

I always start with the "theme" of my song. I may not write it down every time, but I figure it out before I start. Knowing what my song is about, helps me weed out the things that don't "preserve the idea" of my song.

You almost have to protect your work from yourself. There's just so much that you want to say that you have to be careful. Setting your "theme" in stone before you start will put boundaries on your song.

Once you do this, it becomes pretty simple what fits and what doesn't. If a really great idea comes to you just ask yourself, "Does this preserve the theme?"

Now, don't just discard every random idea. Hopefully, you are reading my other stuff and have learned that you need to have something handy to write or record your ideas at all times.

Some of those "random ideas" may be very good lyrics for a different song with a different "theme". There are days where I end up putting down ideas the whole time I'm working.

This usually happens if I have gone a little while without writing. Which I've told you before not to do if possible. Life happens, right? Sometimes it isn't always possible to stay on your schedule.

Do this! **Sit down and decide what your song is about early.** It will make sure a bunch of good ideas doesn't ruin what could have been a great song.

## **Exercise 4. Write every day in every way**

Now, I just admitted to you that I don't always do this. These things are much easier to teach than they are to practice. I am not a paragon of virtue.

I think that's the best kind of teacher though. One who is learning alongside you. Now that I've justified myself. Let's move on, shall we?

**Spending time every day to cultivate your skills is something we should all do.** Like I said earlier the more we do it the better we will get. Bodybuilders work out every day. Why shouldn't we?

I can give you a practical habit to start today. Start humming to yourself. I find this extremely useful when I am in a grouchy mood. It typically takes my mind off whatever I'm butt hurt about.

What generally follows is me making up tunes in my head and trying to put lyrics to them. I've been blessed to write quite a few songs completely in my head by developing the skill of humming.

What you are doing is creating melodies which are just as important as lyrics. I've said this before and I'll say it again.**A good melody can outpace the dumbest lyrics.**

The best way to come up with good melodies is to practice just like writing. Some of your tunes will be stupid but don't worry about it. More will come.

The point is to take some of that energy and put it the good use of creating songs. If you can come up with a catchy melody then half the battle is one. All that's left is to add the lyrics.

Something else that I have employed that I see others use more often is journaling. I've used this tool in the past and it is very helpful. Especially if you have a lot of complicated emotions you want to express.

Writing it all out can help you not only get perspective on how you feel but what you are trying to say. Aah, now we are back around to "theme". Remember, figuring out what your song is about will help you write better.

Sometimes getting an aerial view of your life on paper will bring things together for you. There are several things you can do with that.

You could write about the process of going through the journey. You could write about a specific part of the journey. You could write about your emotions, how you changed, how others changed, what you gained or lost.....

Journaling can unlock a ton of material that you already have right inside your head. Just make sure that you find a "theme" and then "preserve the idea" as you write your song about the journey.

**Prayer is another great way to write every day.**Some of you may not prescribe to this, but I pray constantly and I find it to be a great source of inspiration.

If you are in the genre of "worship" then prayer may be a way to unlock a lot of great songs for you. All one needs to do is look at King David to see that this was his primary writing style.

Even if prayer is not your thing and you aren't a "Christian" you can still meditate. I'm not talking about going up on a hill and sitting on a rock all day with your legs crossed.

Meditation is simply emptying your mind of everything else but what you want to concentrate on. Find time to simply think about the "theme" of your next song or the lyrics of a song you are working on.

Andy Griffith used to always say, "You better think on that thing." Well, I couldn't agree more. The last thing you want is for your heartfelt song to sound like you put five minutes thought into it.

**Stew on it a little while.**I have forced myself to slow down a little when writing. Years ago, I would write as fast as possible for fear of hitting "the wall".

I don't worry too much anymore about hitting "the wall" because I've developed the skills to get around it. If you want to learn about those skills read, "Why is songwriting so hard? How to get past songwriter's block"

What slowing down does is it helps me to meditate on what my song is about more. That keeps stray ideas from making it into my work which makes my writing better. It will do the same for you.

## **Exercise 5. Dis-assemble & re-assemble**

This one is super fun for me. I love to dissect a song and then play with the lyrics and melody. If you are careful you might just become the next "Weird Al!"

This isn't terribly difficult to do and I would bet you've done this before. Simply start with a favorite tune of yours and put your own lyrics to.

Now here's the trick. It's got to make sense whether you're being serious or funny and it's got to match the beat of the song.

You can't violate the syllable count for the sake of being funny. "Who's line is it anyway" got me doing this regularly.

Now, they violate the syllable count all the time and it's hilarious. If you want to improve your skills though stay away from this as much as possible.

Sometimes it's just too irresistible. Especially if your lyrics are in total contrast to the context of the song. Go ahead and get it out of your system.

This is a great way to have a lot of fun and learn a bunch about how to improv lyrics. Over time it will make you super-fast at your "ending rhyme variation" as well. **All around great exercise.**

Right next to this would be dismantling a song. This isn't incredibly difficult it can just be a little challenging at first. What you essentially want to do is to take the song apart as you listen to it.

You can do this with an original or a song from one of the great songwriters you prefer. I recommend that you do both. Don your critical thinking cap and I do mean critical.

As objectively as you can, sit and listen to the song and completely dismantle it in your head. Putting the song on repeat will help you. Do this until you are sick of it.

The song will be lodged in your memory which is what we want. What will happen next is your developed skills as a writer will begin to critique the structure, melody, and lyrics.

If you've got some "superpowers" you'll be critiquing the recording, arrangement, and sound quality as well. Again, this is what we want.

Now, I do want to warn you that developing this skill will change how you hear music permanently. If you don't want that then it's best you stop now. **If you want to be a great songwriter then you have to develop this skill.**

It's likely Willie Nelson is going to coach you how to write and that's ok. If you don't like Willie, we're done. Just joking. Pick someone else you like and put their name in his place.

Point being, they aren't coming to your house for a jam session. No worries. We have the next best thing. Their work. If you can develop this skill I'm teaching you then your favorites can teach you their style without coming over for dinner.

That's what I call a "superpower!" If you want to write like Jim Croce, dissect his music. If you want to write like Snoop Dog, dissect his music. **It's a pretty simple concept that has powerful results.**

Now, look. don't be Vanilla and plagiarize somebody. That's NOT what I'm talking about. Learn their techniques and use them. It's that simple.

Here's what I recommend. You need to find a handful of your favorite artists in your favorite genres and do this. Remember, you will always right your best songs from your niche.

Your niche will never be too far from the music you grew up listening to. If you imagined yourself being AC-DC on stage playing "Thunderstruck" as a kid, chances are that their "style" will make it into your "style".

Don't go nuts with this. Pick about four or five of your absolute favorites of all time. Not what you like right now. The music that shaped the person you are is what we're after.

Once you've got it, listen to it. Begin tearing it apart and critiquing it. See if you can find the flaws or things you can learn from. If you have a good balance of influences you will find your niche and your style.

**Be careful that you always remember how much, throughout your life, went into shaping your style.** Too many writers get frustrated with their lack of growth and try to re-invent themselves.

Doing these exercises will go a long way to helping make sure that you don't hit "the wall" and give up. Stay at it and keep writing. The more you do it the better you will get.

The next thing you know a guy like me will be listening to a person like you trying to dissect your music and learn from it. Well, I waiting. Now go write it!
