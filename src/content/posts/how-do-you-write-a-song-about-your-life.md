excerpt: I have been writing for 25 years now and I would say 90% of the songs I have
  written have come from things that have happened in my life. I would say all
  songs are from some sort of life experience in some way or another.

*How do you write a song about your life?***Tell your story as honestly as you can in the most interesting way with as few words as possible then sing it.#1 As well as you can, summarize your life to a few sentences. Don't be too concerned about the theme or genre just yet. #2 Your words need to come from your heart. You can’t fake this step. #3 Listen to songs you like that are similar to what you want to achieve then start writing.#4 Write again.**

## **Summarizing your life**

Life is complex. More than that it isn't lived all at once. We have circumstances every day that would make great material for writing. We just have to learn to share it.

One key to being able to write about those circumstances is to be able to summarize your experiences in such a way that it captures your meaning or message.

Think about it like this.....when you are window shopping for something you expect to find general info on the product in the store. If want to know every detail you come ask someone like me because I've done the research.

How many times have you nearly fallen asleep listening to a relative, during the holidays, tell you every detail about their life and recent achievements or setbacks? Snooooore.

On the opposite side of that is we all have that one person at work or in our circle of friends that can captivate everyone's attention for hours with their story-telling.

Why do they seem to be able to do that while you are putting people to sleep with your endless barrage of details? Summarization.

You have to master the art of boiling down a story to the most interesting details. After all, you only have about 3.5 minutes to get your message across before.....snoooooore.

If you want to get good at summarizing then stop talking so much. It's a great practice to cut yourself off after so long. Chances are people may be trying to cut you off now.

What you will learn is how to effectively communicate in snippets instead of avalanches. When you know you're gonna run out of words you only say the most important stuff.

## **What's in your heart?**

Out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth speaks. Truer words have never been spoken. That's great though if you think about it.

It means each time you sit down to write about your life something new is bound to come out of you because life changes and people change with it.

Chances are you won't feel the same way about your life next year that you do today. What that means is that you have a never-ending pool of creativity.

It's almost like having a warehouse with an endless amount of free inventory to pull from. More than that the inventory changes with the times and is always relevant.

Another element to consider is the passion factor of writing what's in your heart. You will always be passionate about what you are going through right now in your life.

Now, the scary part is that this takes extraordinary honesty and vulnerability. Which is why most people don't do it. All because of one word, rejection.

Writing from the heart takes a certain level of fearlessness. You have to be willing to face any potential rejection you may receive.

That's why boiling your story down into powerful easy to understand snippets is so important. You will find yourself needing to hear your message.

If you are going to believe in your message it will have to come from the heart. This is something that can not be faked. I've seen it attempted and it's not pretty.

People always know when they are being bs'd. If you don't believe in what you are writing write something else. You want to make a connection and tell your story.

The great thing is that people will respond to your vulnerability by connecting with your song. Not only will they connect but in some cases allow themselves to be touched deeply.

People want to hear your story. The story only you can tell and they will listen so long as you are honest with them. They will know when you are.

## **Listen to other’s music and Write**

If I have said this once I have said it a thousand times, don't reinvent the wheel. Simply paint it a different color.

There is nothing new under the sun. Someone somewhere has written something similar to what you are trying to achieve. You can look at their example.

Now I am not telling you to go plagiarize someone's work. I am merely suggesting that a student is not great than his teacher.

And, if you look hard enough you can find a teacher anywhere. They don't even have to know that they are teaching you so long as you are learning.

Verses, hooks, choruses, repeats, bridges, tags, etc. These are all terms you can learn in an afternoon of research. Don't be intimidated by language or lingo.

The point here is to listen to songs that you enjoy that are in the neighborhood of what you are trying to achieve for your song.

Don't be worried about trying to copy song structure. Songwriters don't own rights to structure but instead to the content. Let me explain what I mean.

Say a song you enjoy is structured like this:

Verse, chorus, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, chorus, end. It's ok to structure your song the same as this. For more on this check out my article on "Do I need to know how to read music to write songs?"

What you want to avoid is copying their music or melody. That is what's called a parody. Kinda like writing your lyrics to the tune of "twinkle twinkle little star". That'll get you in trouble.

The point of listening is to find a structure or tune you like and then build off of that. Maybe change the tune a little bit or even a lot. You will obviously have your own lyrics.

You will be amazed at how much a song will change as you begin to play with the lyrics and the melody. It will begin to have a life of its own. I think sometimes it's harder to do parody than originals.

Trust me. All the great song writers have built off the ideas of other songwriters. There are very few completely original ideas and even those are repeats if we looked far enough back into time.

That is the beauty of sharing your song. It will eventually help someone just like you to sit down and write their song for others to hear. And so on and so on.

## **Write again and again and again**

That brings me to the last thing. Write as much as you can. Nothing will stifle your creativity like not using your gift on a regular basis. The more you practice the easier it will get.

Like a snowball rolling down a hill of snow, your talent will grow. In most cases, you will experience the most growth early on. So write as much as you can. It doesn't matter if you write a hit song every time.

Just write. Rinse and repeat. Don't give up. And write it down. For goodness sake don't try to memorize everything. You won't be able to remember it.

Get yourself a notebook or a composition book from the store and start writing. Even if you don't have melodies for everything. Even if it doesn't rhyme just yet. We will work on that later. I put a link to the type of composition book I use below.

The biggest thing is to get it down and get it out. I have even seen poetry turned into great songs. The last thing you want to do is forget something that was so important to you.

One great way you can utilize your smartphone is to take advantage of the "memos" app. It's a great tool for jotting down ideas. If you are like me then you have things hit you when it is the most inconvenient.

I don't always have time to sit down and complete a song from start to finish and the memos app really helps me to get those ideas out of my head before I forget them.

Another very helpful tool for writing is the voice recorder app on my phone. I will admit that this is my go-to when it comes to putting down rough cuts of songs or just ideas.

If you want to go big or if you're a serious writer you could get yourself a multi-track recorder but I would suggest putting some time into figuring out how much you enjoy this before shelling out the doe.

My favorite multi-track recorder is definitely the Roland Br-800. I have one of these and have owned other Roland products. It is the best platform, in my opinion, for songwriters. You can pick one up for around $250 (used) or $450 (new). I put a link below.

There are lots of great things you can do to put your ideas down. The point is to write and write as often as you can and you will get better. Most importantly, have fun.
