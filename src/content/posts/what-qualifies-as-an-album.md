excerpt: Albums. There is a word I haven't used in a long time. A lot of things have
  changed over the past two decades in the music industry. Albums are one of
  them.

*What qualifies as an album?* **An album is an artist/s body of work that typically has a common theme. #1 An album will have between 8-12 songs as a general rule. #2 That collection of songs will usually have a similar theme. The artist/s are trying to tell you something. #3 Creating albums involves many people and/or many functions.**



## **How many songs do I need?**

Back in the day, and I mean not too long ago, albums were all the rage. Many a kid could be found down at the local music store searching for their favorite artist/s.



When I say album, I'm closely associating albums with CD's, cassettes, and vinyls because those were our mediums of consumption. If you wanted to listen to one song you had to buy all 12.



And 12 was typically what was on any given "album" you would buy. **It wasn't cheap either.** I think I paid $16 for my first "Collective Soul" album. I only wanted the song "Shine" but that was the deal.



You had to buy the whole thing to get the one you loved. That worked great for the artist/s, producers, and the record companies.



The costs to produce an entire album may have been higher but they made it up on the back end by selling people songs they didn't necessarily want.



If you were like me and that bugged you a little you might have found yourself trying to force yourself to like every single song on the album so you could feel a little better about the $16 you spent.



Things have changed a lot since the **golden days** of music stores, cd's, cassettes, and vinyls. The internet and Mp3s changed everything. Now you can get the one song you want for $1 downloaded to your phone.



There's no need to buy the entire album anymore. It has made record companies, artists/s, and producers re-think their approach to making albums.



They are still creating a "body of work" for you to consider buying but it's becoming more about that one "hit song" than the whole album.



## **The story behind the music**

I don't want you to get the impression that albums are dead and gone. They are not. They are very much alive. It's just that they don't sell like they used to.



Albums used to **tell you a story** about the artist/s. I say that as a general rule. Not everybody did this but most did because it was a chance to capture their audience more deeply.



It may still be this way to an extent but back in the day the **artwork on the label cover,** the font of the lyrics, and the packaging were just as important as how good the songs were.



An artist/s could tell you as much about the album with the cover art as they could their number one hit song off that same album. In a lot of cases, the art would sell the album.



The record companies knew if they could package it well you would buy it even if you only liked the one song and it worked. I can't remember all the stupid conversations I've had about this.



"**Oh yeah, dude? Well, I own the "box set"**. That song sounds better on the box set than it does the regular album." My favorite one is the argument about "live" albums.



"Hey man, I have the live version and it's way better than the box set!" Yeah, don't let anybody fool you. We used to argue about it. I bet you can still find some of us out there who would argue about it.



It became bragging rights as a listener. The record companies were brilliant. They used everything about those albums to draw us into the theme of the artist/s story.



Everybody wants to know **the story** behind the songs. Those albums were like a little window into the artist/s and producer's mind. We ate it up back then.



It's kind of sad that owning albums is slowly starting to die off. Now when you brag about having a "box-set" people look at you like you're a freak who wears "Collective Soul" pajamas to bed.



## **Putting an album together**

Oh my goodness is it a lot of work to compile a good album. If you do it right, that is. That's why it takes so many people to get it done. Not just anyone can do it.



These "independent artist/s" out here who do everything and do it well are amazing. They have figured out how to be their own miniature record company essentially.



**Bringing a radio worthy album to market is no easy task.** I mean just think about the recording quality. Most professional artists record in studios that can range from 100k to 1mil dollars.



What is all that $ for? Equipment baby. You have to have top of the line equipment to make top-notch music. You also have to have someone who knows how to use it properly.



**Engineers are incredible** at hearing the slightest variations in frequency and tone. A good engineer can absolutely make your album sell more copies. A bad engineer can do the opposite.



Producers are the idea guys standing in the studio smoking cigarettes watching you do a vocal take and shaking their heads. "Do it again," they say. I'll give you do it again grrrr...... Sorry, moving on.



**You can't forget your studio musicians**. If you have ever had a chance to see some of these people in action then you know what I'm talking about. The best players in the world and nobody knows they exist for the most part.



Then you have the clerical people who compile your lyrics for booklets, sheet music, etc. Cover art folks. marketing, copyright, distribution. The list goes on. Next time you pick up an album remember this.



**The most important part of the entire album process** **is the songs.** If you don't have good songwriting then you can't sell the album. Even good artwork can't outpace bad songs.



So before the artist/s ever venture off into all of the work of bringing their songs to the public for purchase they have spent countless hours pouring over their body of work to make sure it's worthy.



**Some artist/s are still fighting the good fight** of trying to produce entire albums with a great theme. They believe that you can still sell albums if all of the songs are equally good.



Then there are the types who only want sale the next big hit song and the rest of the stuff on their album just **"filler"**. It depends on if they are more of an artist or a professional.



The driving force behind albums is money. Simply because it is so much work to put it together. You want to make sure that it will sell.



Now there is the **exception** that you are an art geek and there are those out there who full albums of all their weird music that they made while on "cloud cuckoo land".



Because albums are so much work, you have to make sure that it's worth it to you. **What is satisfactory compensation for you?** Is it selling albums or having a finished body of work in your hands.



I mentioned earlier the awesome independent artist/s out there. They do all the above roles themselves. Hence the term independent artists.



They don't use the power of a record company to bring their albums to market. They do it themselves. That's impressive. How do they do all of this?



They love what they do and they have figured out a way to get paid for it. **It's as simple as that.** Finding that balance between profession and artist is essential if you want to tackle an album.



If for no other reason than it is so much work to do it right. No, if you want to go throw something together that nobody will listen to that's fine.



But I wager that's not what you want. You want to share your music with the world and I want you to do that. **So set yourself up for success.**



Spend some time thinking and researching how much work this takes and if you are ready to learn and do the things that need to be done to get your album out there.



Also, next time you are shopping for music **take a moment** to bow your head in reverence to all those who made it possible for you to listen.



I can't wait to go into the next online music store, free from teenage body odor, to find your next album. I hope it's as good as I think it will be. Now go write it!
