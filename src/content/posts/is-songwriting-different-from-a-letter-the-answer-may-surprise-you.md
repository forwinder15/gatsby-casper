excerpt: I have written a lot of letters in my day and sung a few I might add. Gone are
  the days when you used to have to worry about a sing-o-gram showing up at your
  house.

*Is songwriting different from a letter?* **No. Songwriting is a letter in song format. 1. Songs and letters share a similar function. They both are conveying a message. 2. Songs and letters have the same audience. The person/s you wrote them for. 3. Songs and letters need an ending. Finish your song.**

## **Birds of a feather**

Way back in the day you used to be sitting around the living room watching the tube when the bell would ring. "See who that is," someone would shout.

You would open the door to see a person, in some cases, **dressed like a dork,** standing there with flowers and a card of some kind staring at you.

They might have pulled out one of those little circular tuning kazoos and blew into it, "Waaaa." The next thing you heard was an off-key version of "Happy Birthday" or worse, a horribly written love letter.

As awkward or weird as this seems, it captures what happens when you transform a letter or message into a song. Depending on how hard you try **it can be good or bad.**

The letter is simply the long format of what you are trying to say to someone. A song summarizes your letter in as few words as possible.

Now, how you do this can **make or break your song.** If you pick the most boring stuff chances are no one will enjoy it. So you have to keep in mind to use the best parts of your letter.

The message in your song should **communicate exactly** what your letter does. So you have to find the heart of what you are trying to say. Boil it down to a quote if you can.

One of my favorite examples is a Jerry Clower story. This guy found a way to say exactly what needed to be said in a song. I attached a YouTube link so you can **listen for yourself.**

## **This song's for you**

If you have ever written a letter you will have put: Dear (person's name), at the top of your letter. **Take an email for example.** You have to address this letter to a certain person before you can send it.

You may not have started your song with "Dear whoever", but you did have a person/s in mind when you wrote it. Now don't forget, there are songs that start with "Dear whoever".

You can certainly use the letter format in your song structure. Always remember that this is your personal work of art no different than a letter you would write to someone. It's from you to someone else.

Make it yours. The audience or person you intend this for will know if you are genuine so keep that in mind as you write. Letters are personal. Songs are no different.

That may be something to think about further as well. Is this going to be something you write for a special someone that you never share or is this for "all those people out there who need love"?

Determining who your audience is **will change** the way you write your song. I mean, I can't see you sending an email to your boss that says:

Dear Boss,

**"You know it's true. Everything I do. I do it for you"** (Bryan Adams)

That would be awkward, right? It would be the same in the other direction with your special someone in your life. You definitely don't want to sing a song to her like this:

**"Take this job and shove it. I ain't workin' here no more"** (Johnny Paycheck)

Use your head a little and you will be surprised at how people will respond to the personal nature of your writing. Folks want to make a connection. Just make sure you are talking to them.

One way you can do this, in particular, is to watch how you use personal pronouns. Here is what "all of us" mean. See, that didn't work did it?

Make sure your pronouns are appropriate to your intended audience. You don't want to make the screw up of putting a line in your love song:

**"My love is only for "them".....mmmm... baby"** (original)

Obviously "you" was the right pronoun for this situation, right? I know that sounds incredibly simply or maybe even a little insulting but you would be surprised how many writing mistakes are pronoun issues.

You have to decide if you are **talking directly** to someone about themselves or are you **telling them about someone else.** Many a song has fallen apart because the writer couldn't figure this out.

## **The beginning, the middle, and the…...**

Nothing sucks as bad an incomplete letter, email, or song. Especially one that is so very good all the way up until..................

See what I mean? Finish the song. Now, I say that with grace because I myself have a couple of unfinished songs. They are incubating or I am trying to find time to complete them.

Other times you just hit **"the wall"** and "You can't go around it, you can't go over it, you can't go through......." Ok, that's enough of that. You get my point.

We have all been there. Even the big boys up in Nashville get writer's block. All of us do. So don't go weeping and sobbing somewhere like you can't do this because you can.

**When this happens you can do a few things.** 

1. You come to somebody like me and let me see what you've got. Now don't send me a blank piece of paper unless you want me to send you a request for many of the government's printed pieces of paper $$. I can help you get over the hump in a lot of cases. 
2. Take a planned break. Now that sounds suspiciously like what you may be doing now but it's not. Planned means it has a time limit. Once you have gathered your thoughts, get back to work. 
3. Change the structure a little bit. Sing the verses and choruses out of order and see if that changes things a little. It may give you a new idea.

No matter what your letter will have a beginning, a middle, and an end. I suppose you were expecting me to start with that, right? So why didn't I?

Mostly because there are a thousand ways to write songs. If you want to start your song with an introduction, then move into the meat, and then finally close it down then fine.

There are tons of styles of how to do this though. I will share two with you. #1 is "story-telling" style writing which is like what I described. Below are a few examples of good story-telling:

**"Cat's in the cradle", "Hey Jude", "Ballad of Big Jim"**

Story-telling is a really popular way to write it is very enjoyable to listen to. We all love to hear other people's stories about their own experiences.

This is a great place to start if you are new to writing. It's probably the best place to start, really. You will more than likely find this type of writing to be the easiest at the beginning.

Now onto something a little bit different. #2 This is what I call "Proclamation" style writing. This is where you have a message for the world to hear. Below are a few examples:

**"Who let the dogs out?", "Imagine", "Stairway to heaven"**

This is still a letter of sorts but it's not necessarily a story. It's more of an announcement. You are simply trying to tell everyone that, "This is where I stand on this issue."

I would encourage you to give both of these a try and see which one comes easier. Just remember to finish. Start your message, get to the meat, and then wrap it up.

You can' begin if you don't begin, no one will listen if you never say anything, and absolutely everyone hates to but cut off in the midd.........

**Gotcha again!** You can do this. I can't wait to hear what you come up with. Remember don't send me a blank page. I might write a song about a person who sent me a blank page. Now go write!
