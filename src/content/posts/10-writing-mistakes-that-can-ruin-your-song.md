excerpt: I have made plenty of mistakes over the past 25 years of writing songs. Very
  few of those mistakes completely ruined my songs. Chances are these are the
  same mistakes you are making. Let me show you.

# **Mistake 1. Failure To Launch**

This is the worst mistake you could ever make writing songs. I have preached on this over and over again. An unfinished song isn't a song it's poetry.

I have made this mistake in my career a lot of times. At one point I stopped but it was only because a mentor of mine got in my face a rebuked me for not finishing.

This is the worst habit you can allow to develop as a songwriter. It will literally foster writer's block. You are essentially training your brain to have a limit on its creativity.

Stop stopping and start finishing. I would recommend starting right now that for every new idea you work on that you make yourself dust off an unfinished idea and complete it.

Not only will this fuel your fire to be more creative but it will train you to be able to write complete songs without getting stuck.

A big portion of the songwriters I work with get stuck because they have trained themselves to stop after the first chorus. Keep going! I want to hear it when you're done with it.

## **Mistake 2. I Forgot My Pen**

Holy cow! I could smack myself so hard right now just thinking about all the songs that will never be written because I either didn't write them down or didn't record them.

I get reminded of this from time to time when I sit down with another writer who is making this mistake. I am always excited to hear another writer's work but my heart drops when I don't get to hear all of it because they can't remember how it goes.

Always, always, always have your notebook with you. If you play guitar or piano then you have literally no excuse not to do this. Especially if you keep sheet music or lead sheets with you for practice.

You will carry other people's music around in a by-fold but not your own!? You have to break this habit. Your notebook needs to be like your diary. You should know exactly where it is at all times.

I use the "memo" app on my phone to capture nearly all of my inconvenient ideas which accounts for about 90% of my ideas. Inspiration hardly ever strikes at a convenient time.

If I have a melody to go with my idea, I will break out my "voice-recorder" app on my phone and save it for later. With today's technology, you have zero excuses here. Write it down!

## **Mistake 3. Premature Debut**

I have had to learn my lessons the hard way with this one. If you are like me and you love writing you will agree that there is certain angst or urgency that you feel to share your music.

That is a wonderful thing because that underlying desire to tell the world will actually drive you to complete your songs Which will and make them the best they can be if you learn how to harness it.

If you don't harness that feeling it will be like the horse at the Kentucky Derby that keeps launching from the gate before the race has started. You think you can win this thing with your eyes closed, and I believe in you but hold your horses.

Let's make sure that your song is actually finished before you walk up on stage and make yourself and everyone else uncomfortable with your epic fail. And it will be epic if you don't get your timing down.

Always get a trusted second opinion before you launch a song. I sometimes get three or four opinions. Now, don't just take what they say to heart. Consider your own feelings as well and make a balanced decision.

Just be open to the fact that we are all biased about our own songs sometimes and an objective point of view can help us get back to balance. If four out of four people say your baby is ugly then it's probably ugly. My condolences.

## **Mistake 4. "Let It Go, Let It Go"**

If you are the type of writer that gets so sentimentally attached to your songs that you can not let go then you may need some counseling. I mean that as sincerely as I can possibly mean it.

This is right up there with bad timing and being too bias. Do not get your identity tied to the success or failure of your work. I know that is easier said than done but you have got to figure this out.

If your life can be totally wrecked by the rejection of your work or one failed song then you are out of balance. I believe you may be writing for the wrong reasons. You have to write because you love it. Failure and rejection are inevitable.

Unfortunately, the only way to train yourself to do this is to go through the grieving process. I can't teach how to embrace the fact that your song sucks. You have to do your own believing and your own dying.

If you don't except the death of a song, you will find yourself trying to resurrect it like a mad scientist. Next thing you know you will have created the dreaded "Frankensong" There is a reason people are running from you when you come around.

They are afraid your "Creation" is going to come "ALIVE!" and kill them. Unless you want to find yourself in a straight-jacket at the nut barn, learn to grieve your losses and move on with life. There will be more songs.

## **Mistake 5. El Solo Lobo**

There is nothing worse than a swellhead songwriter. They can't "bring it," but they can sure "sing it."No one is as good as they think they are and nothing will convince of that more than hanging around other writers.

I have met some phenomenal writers in my day, and I knew exactly how much I don't know when I was with them. Especially when we write together. There are some really talented people out there.

One of the best pieces of advice I can give you is to let down your guard and work with some of these folks. If you are like me you will find out exactly how much you suck. It's great for the ego.

Most of us reject arrogance from others, but we are often blind to it when it comes to ourselves. Getting around other writers regularly is a great way to keep you from thinking you are the end all be all.

Isolation will only stifle your creativity whereas community will cause it to flourish. God didn't create us to live life alone. Besides, the "lone-wolf" mentality undermines the whole reason we write. Hopefully, you are writing to help others in some way.

Our best work happens when we do it for the love of others around us. "Love your neighbor as yourself." Who knows how many songs will come from building relationships with the people around you?

## **Mistake 6. Light Under A Bushel**

How can I hear a song you have written if you don't ever share it with me? This is what happens when you don't head the advice I gave earlier. Eventually, you will stop sharing your work.

"A wounded brother is harder to win than a strong city." Sometimes when we get hurt bad, we just shut down indefinitely. There's really nothing anyone can do to help either because we've convinced ourselves that everyone is out to hurt us.

This is where writers come to die and it is exactly why it is so important for you to have a writing troupe that you meet with regularly. **We all need encouragement and sometimes a shoulder to cry on.**

Now, for the one who won't come out of the closet and share your gift with us. Stop worrying about what the world will think. Start small. Pick one person you really trust and share your work with them. Then pick two, and so on.

If you keep trying to eat the elephant all at once you are eventually going to give up. Besides, if you ever did manage to swallow it all you would die. We all and I mean all, were nervous just like you once. In truth, I still get nervous sometimes.

To get past my nerves, I take a deep, breathe and simply remember why I do what I do. If that doesn't work, I read my lyrics to myself and think about how I felt while I was writing that song and then I sing from that place. Come on. I want to hear your song!

## **Mistake 7. Fake, Fake, Fake!**

If you don't believe in you why should anyone else? I can not stand dis-ingenious songwriting. I suspect most people feel the same. Nobody wants to be bs'd. You have to believe in what you are saying.

We are all pretty guarded with our emotions. **It can be difficult to get people to open up and let you in.** That is impossible when you aren't being real. Mostly because people aren't stupid!

Don't expect to get very far trying to fool people into thinking you have lived your song. That connection you make as a songwriter is almost supernatural. Which only makes sense since God created music.

I believe that's people, as a general rule, can just tell whether you are real or not. You've experienced this yourself. I'm sure. We have all heard an artist who just didn't believe in what they were singing, writing, or playing. Don't do this.

At best, you don't have the right motives for being a songwriter. At worst, you are trying to manipulate people's emotions to get them to buy your songs. Even if you have some success, trust me it will be short-lived.

Besides, a lie will never triumph over the truth. The truth will out. The best connections I have ever made are the songs that came from the pain and joy in my life. You want to make people cry? Be real with them.

## **Mistake 8. Be yourself**

This is a real close second to being fake to get either approval or money. Stop trying to be something you are not! Most of the writers that fall into being fake are there because the ventured away from their roots.

I don't care which style is more popular! Besides, you suck at it anyway because it isn't your niche. If you are doing this only for money then do something else. The industry will chew you up and spit you out if you don't stay true to who you are.

Besides, your message is the one I want to hear. If I want to hear another fake song, I can turn on the radio. I want to hear something genuine from the heart. You can worry about money later.

Find your niche early on or you will get lost. It's not hard to find. Just ask yourself what songs you've heard in your life that you absolutely love. Find more of those and listen.

That is more than likely going to be your niche. Don't worry if it's completely different from everyone else. It's supposed to be. You are the only you there is and nobody can be you better than you.

Do you see it? I see it. Better still, I believe in you. Don't be afraid of what others think. Without resistance growth is impossible. The harder the wind blows the higher a bird can soar when let's go. So let go and be yourself.

## **Mistake 9. Continuing Education**

Speaking of growth, you have to keep learning and honing your craft. A trap we often fall into is to think we have it figured out after writing a couple really good songs. Nobody is ever done learning.

You should at least one mentor, one peer, and one student. This way you are getting three different perspectives. This will keep you sharp and humble. Two things we all need more of.

Listening is not agreeing, by the way. You can hear someone out without changing every blessed thing you've ever done. Learn the noble art of "gleaning the meat off the chicken without choking on the bones."

Here are a few things I do that you may think about:

* **Read regularly.**
* **Find a few other songwriters to work with.**
* **Get a student or two that you can teach.**
* **Share your work as often as you can.**
* **Listen to the work of famous writers you love.**

Songwriting isn't rocket science but that doesn't mean we have to stop learning. You never know how many songs will come from that new technique or life-changing book that you read. Keep learning.

## **Mistake 10. Never Give Up**

It's a very sad thing to find out that a writer has stopped writing. It's almost like a death. A voice that was once heard has been silenced in some way and it always grieves me a little.

I've seen it happen in many ways but the three things that have claimed more lives in songwriting are:

* **Failure**
* **Rejection**
* **The Wall**

What's so sad it there isn't one of these that can not be beaten if you will just do the things I am trying to teach you. So please, if you happen to know a great writer who has given up send them to me. I want to help them.

If you are a budding writer, please heed my advice. You will be a success if you do. Don't get caught up on fame and fortune. That is not what makes a writer a success.

What makes you a success is using your God-given gift to change the lives around you for the better. You can't succeed in this if you give up. You have to keep writing.

For those who have been beaten down and have walked away, come back. We miss you. For those who have given up before they started, what are you waiting for? For those of you who have stayed the course, who are you encouraging?

We need each other. Don't isolate. Anytime you forget who you are. Come here and I will remind you. Don't fake it. Be real and touch our hearts. Don't hide your light under a bushel.

Above all keep writing! Start a songwriting troupe where you are and keep each other encouraged. Work together. Collaborate. Learn from one another and teach each other.

Create beautiful songs the way God intended for you to and go share them. I am sitting here waiting for you to finish, so I can hear what you've written. Now go write it!
