**As writers, we all go through dry spells from time to time.**You know what? That's ok. We can't expect to create a number one hit every time we sit down and write. If we were able to do that we'd be famous.

There's no shame in hitting "the wall" or going blank. We just need to figure out how to blow the wall to pieces and turn on your light bulb. **That's where having my cheat sheet comes in**.

Yep, that's what I said. Cheat sheet. Idea book. Prompts. Call'em what you will. This is a secret weapon. All great songwriters use one. Don't let anybody fool you. **Having a list of prompts doesn’t make you less of a writer.**

**This is actually one of the smartest things you can do.** Over time you are going to come up with a lot more ideas than you write. What do you do with all those ideas? Write them down and save them. Tada! Cheat sheet.

**What I've done here is give you a jump start.** I have taken time to categorize the list so it's easier to use. Next time you go bone dry whip this booger out and let it inspire you to write something new.

Go a step further and add your ideas to it as well. Why stop at 126? Keep going! And please feel free to change the ones I have provided. That's the whole idea. I want you to get in the habit of doing this yourself. Make it your own.

You will also notice that I have provided you with some "rough" titles or hooks to the right of each line. Feel free to change those as well. **Oh, if you want to know a BIG SECRET about this cheat sheet scroll to the bottom.**

**This is absolutely 100% FREE for you to download.** Put it on your device/s and use it as you please. Change it again and again and make it your own. Are you ready to write your next awesome song? Then without further a due here we go.

Oh yeah, **make sure you have fun!**

## **The Big Secret**

Ok. You made it through. **I got a big secret for you.** This cheat sheet will literally transform into an **UNLIMITED** supply of inspiration for you if you play around with it.

Try interchanging and combining each line item using these three principals:

- **Subject** - change the theme. Ask these questions: who, what, when, where, why, and how?
- **Perspective** - change who's speaking. Write in 1st person, 2nd person, or 3rd person.
- **Metaphors** - change the title or hook. Use quotes, puns, and figures of speech to create new titles and hooks.

**How many different variations you can come up with?** I would love to hear your feedback and any new ideas you get using this list. I'm sitting here waiting to hear your new song. Now go write it!

Thank you for reading!
