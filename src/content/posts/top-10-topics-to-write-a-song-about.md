## Cheat Sheet Shame

Every writer gets stuck now and then. Do not ever feel ashamed for having a "cheat sheet" of ideas. No matter what you may hear, **every songwriter does this**. The ones that are good songwriters, that is.

What I've done here is take the **Top 10** from my list of **126**, and give you a little more detail. You must get in the habit of doing this for yourself. So make sure you are writing down and recording all of the ideas you have as they come.

It won't take long before your list is longer than mine. Next time you feel uninspired, simply pull out your "cheat sheet". For now, use mine and feel free to add to it or change it. There's a link at the bottom of this post to access your **FREE** copy. Enjoy the read.

**Top 10 Topics to Write a Song About**

## 1. Write about what you believe about God and why. 

If you've come to Christ, you have a lot to say. Simply sit down and write out some part of your testimony and put it to music.

Another way would be to make the song entirely about the character of God. For instance, you may write a song about his faithfulness and goodness. **Endeavor to use scriptures for your inspiration.**

Speaking of scriptures, Psalms is a great place to start if you want to write a song about God. King David is arguably the greatest songwriter that ever lived. He has more psalms than anyone else in the bible.

## 2. Write about who you are.

This can range from things you love about your life to what you are passionate about. Write a song about your favorite type of food. Jimmy Buffet did. "Cheeseburger in paradise!"

Tell a great story about a time when you were growing up. Maybe you caught a really big fish when you were a kid. Write a song about it. **Songs about growing up are always good songs.**

One more to consider would be to write a song about your politics. Many artists have done this. Although I don't agree with his premise, John Lennon wrote a wildly popular song called "Imagine." See if you can find any other examples to listen to for inspiration.

##3. Write about a relationship. 

This can be a fun topic because there are so many possibilities. You can write a song about a son and a father like "Cats in the cradle", or a son to a mother like "Bohemian Rhapsody".

Maybe you have a relationship with someone who isn't exactly what they claim to be. Write a song about hypocrisy. You could also write a song about meeting a new interesting person. Call it, "Hello." Just an idea.

## 4. Write about love. 

This has to be one of the most popular topics in songwriting. After the topics of God and faith, I would say this is the next one on the list. **You may even see it as the number one topic.**

It's not hard to understand why. We all have plenty of personal experiences when it comes to love. Whether it's jilted love, tainted love, new love, or old love, there's always something to write about.

You may have a harder time deciding what type of love experience you want to write about. I find that it's easier if I start with something that has happened to me or someone I'm close to, and then experiment with that.

Don't be afraid to try new things. You may even decide to use fake names and places to give your song more depth. It will get really fun once you start to branch out a little bit.

## 5. Write about pain. 

This one is definitely next on the list. Mostly because it's the very next thing we feel when we lose someone we love. **Be careful not to get trapped in that "love loss" box though.**

As you well know, there are plenty of other ways to experience pain in life. You may have lost a promotion that you were counting on, or your house may have burned down.

Any painful experience is an opportunity for a great song. Just an idea, try interviewing people if you're fresh out of perspective. Writing about another person's pain is both cathartic and educational.

## 6. Write about friendship. 

Many great songs were written on this subject. James Taylor's "You've got a friend" always comes to my mind when I think about friendship. **That's just how powerful a good song can be.**

You may have a friendship from your past that would make a great story for a song. Perhaps it is someone that you are still great friends with. If not, you may know someone else who had this experience.

Like I said earlier, it's always a good idea to be open to interviewing people about their life to get perspective and inspiration. **Don't make the mistake of limiting yourself to your own experiences.**

## 7. Write about family. 

This is another great topic to write about. Maybe you have a war hero in the family who's story has never been told. **Those always make great songs.**

Did your dad or grandpa take you fishing as a kid? Maybe your uncle taught you how to drive a car. What about your grandma's buttermilk biscuits? Yum! All song worthy topics. Especially grandma's biscuits!

Maybe your family relationships weren't so good. It might just be the best thing for your healing process to write a song about it. Again, you can change the names and places if you want. As long as the story is preserved.

## 8. Write about something funny. 

Some of my favorite songs are in this category. Toby Kieth's "Wanna talk about me" is a hilarious song. Funny doesn't necessarily mean goofy.

I must admit that I do like a goofy song every now and then. I think everyone in my generation grew up listening to Weird Al and Ray Stevens. Those were really fun songs that we all loved.

Try using puns and one-liners to get started. You can also get inspiration by listening to songs by the two guys I just mentioned. You may even know a song or two that you think is funny. "Ain't nobody got time for dat!"

## 9. Write about a special object. 

"Three wooden crosses" is probably my favorite example of this type of song. It doesn't necessarily have to be a song about faith. I just like that song. It's a great example of being inspired by a special object.

You may have an heirloom that was passed down to you that is very special. Write a song about it and the story that surrounds it. It might be a medal of honor or an old watch.

This topic could also include a house, car, boat, or a fishing rod. Any object that you can think of that could hold special meaning is a song waiting to be written. **If you don't have a personal experience, make one up.**

## 10. Write about some kind of animal. 

This could be grandma's lapdog or the nasty alley cat down the street. What makes these songs really great is when there's a catchy name or pun for the animal being sung about.

For instance, a song about a junkyard dog called "Junkyard scrap" or a song about your favorite fish called "I have a great tuna". You are allowed to be funny when writing about animals. It is no crime.

If you want to write something more sentimental, then pick a story from your past. If you don't have a story, then interview someone who had a special pet. There are plenty of great stories if you go looking for them.

**Ok.** That's my list of the **Top 10 Topics to Write Song About**. I think if you stick with it, we may be listening to your next song on the radio. Don't forget to experiment. There's nothing in the rule book that says you can't combine these topics with one another.

Also, keep your ears open when you are out in public, at church, work, or around the dinner table. You never know when someone is going to share a story or tall-tale that would make a great song.

If you go prospecting you may find songwriting gold. Alright. So now I'm sitting here anticipating your next great song. Well, what are you waiting for? **Go write it! **
