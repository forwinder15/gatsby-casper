excerpt: Writing a song about yourself can seem a little daunting if you don't know
  where to start. I can show you how to eat the elephant one bite at a time. 90%
  of the songs I have written over 25 years have been about my life experiences
  in form or another. Let me show you.

*How do you write a song about yourself?* **You have to be concise, honest, and fearless. Then you have to go do it. 1. You have to learn to summarize your message or the part of your life you want to share in a few sentences. 2. You will need to be vulnerable and honest. 3. Start writing as much as you can. Practice makes perfect.**

## **Too much information (TMI)**

Have you ever gone somewhere and ran into someone that you haven't seen for ten or fifteen years and found yourself still standing there talking after thirty minutes have gone by?

This happens to my wife all the time. Sometimes it's cool because I have other things I can get into to keep myself busy. When I don't though, it drives me bonkers.

The worst is when it is somebody you like but they are annoying, you know what I mean? This person isn't a bad person they are actually quite likable. But they are just annoying enough to make you cringe when you see them coming.

The most annoying type of person to me is the one who can't read body language. They are the ones who you have to coach through the polite niceties and manners of trying to properly end a conversation and walk away.

"**Ok dude, I'll see ya (hand wave)**"..... and they just stand there staring at you waiting for the conversation to continue. You want so bad to walk off but your inner good person is saying, "Don't be rude."

The other type is the person who is like a premature rocket launch. You run into them and make the mistake of trying to ask how they've been, "Hey man, how are y.." BOOM! Thirty minutes later it feels like you've been hit by a car.

I gotta be careful here because truth be told you and I both are probably just as guilty of this, am I right? We all run off at the mouth sometimes and sometimes that's ok. Let me show you how to take advantage of that as a songwriter.

## **Develop interviewing skills**

The very best thing for you as a songwriter is too much information. Not in the song, but for source material. You are kinda like an investigative reporter who writes songs and not articles.

You need to know as much information **as possible** so you can go through it and pick out what stands out to you. A blabbermouth is a great source of song material if you just let them talk.

Sometimes these people can even speak in song lyrics if you learn to develop your interviewing skills. **You just have to know what to listen for**. Starting with yourself is the best place to start.

So, that means you get to run into yourself and talk your own ear off about what's been going on in your life. Just make sure one of you has a piece of paper to jot it all down.

Start with a full-page or pages for that matter. Sit down and write what's on your heart. Check out my article on "[How to write a song about my life](/posts/how-do-you-write-a-song-about-your-life/)" for a good look at writing **from the heart.**

The important part is to spill the beans. Give us all the **nitty-gritty** details so we can pick through it to find the really interesting stuff that will capture people's attention. Exactly like a reporter would do.

A great way to get started if you are stuck is to ask questions. Now, these questions have to be better than, "**Who's your favorite care-bear?**" These need to be probing and invasive questions.

Once you start answering these questions you should hit your stride. If you hit the wall instead, have someone else ask you questions. If you haven't figured it out we want the stuff you don't talk to people about.

Hopefully, you won't make yourself too uncomfortable. I don't want you to get caught in an awkward moment where you can't walk away from yourself without being rude to yourself.

## **Be vulnerable and honest**

Nobody likes a liar. On the other hand, folks are fascinated with freaky people. You just gotta make sure that you are the later, and not the former. Don't lie about being freaky.

I know that sounds stupid but it's true. Artists are a little bit freaky and you have set out to join our troupe. Writing songs about the most intimate parts of your life freaks other people out.

That's why they aren't doing this and you are. **Face it,** if you have interviewed yourself yet then you've just spent a lot of time talking to yourself about yourself for yourself. If you're like me you even argued back a little.

**Don't be that person** who makes everything awkward by making a terrible attempt at pretending to be freaky when you are not. Just be honest and you will be freaky.

Everybody lies to protect themselves from ridicule. Songwriters are the most honest people I've ever known. They risk it all by putting it out there for people to ridicule and judge.

**Does that scare you?** I wouldn't be surprised. I still get nervous sharing the new stuff I write. But oh man the rush I get once it's out there or I've performed it is amazing. Everybody wants to be heard.

The ones who lie are too scared. **What does that make you?** Fearless. Writing songs about yourself is one of the most courageous things you could attempt to do. You are doing what no one else wants to do.

You are being honest in a brutal and critical world. What's awesome about that is the truth is exactly what this cruel world needs to hear and no one can tell the truth about you better than you.

**There is no one you-er than you.** So don't let any fear of judgment or criticism scare you out of doing what you have set out to do. Someone out there is waiting to hear your story. I know I am.

## **Sum it all up**

As great as having too much information is for finding the gold nuggets in your story, it's just too much information in a song. You have to become a master at summarizing.

You can do several things to bulk up your summarizing muscles. Check out my article on "How to write a song about my life" for some more info on summarizing. I'll tell you what I do.

I read quotes. This is one of the best exercises that you can do when learning to boil things down to the simplest form. A good quote tells you so much about how a person thinks and feels.

If thinking about your story in **quotes** seems a little too big at this point then let's start smaller. Take your page or pages that you have and read them. Now get a highlighter.

What you are going to do is **highlight the things that stand out** to you and resonate with your heart. The parts of your story that you are very passionate about or maybe even cried a little while writing.

Now you are going to re-read your story **again** and be thinking of how to condense it into a single paragraph using all of the places you highlighted. Re-peat this step until you have about seven to ten sentences.

Now enter the quotes. I want you to **re-read** your condensed paragraph and summarize that paragraph into one sentence. That one sentence is your chorus or the hook of your song. The heartbeat of your message.

**That heartbeat** is your quote about yourself. All that's left is to put it to a melody and decide on a song structure that best suits the message you want to communicate.

There is only a couple of things you need to know about how to construct a song once you have the message and they never change. The format you use may change but the principles always stay the same. Structure and melody.

Now don't freak out. You don't need to know how to read music to finish your song. Check out my article "Do I need to know how to read music to write songs?" for more information on this.

Stop and congratulate yourself if you have reached the point of having a chorus and a paragraph. What you have is a song that just needs to be organized. That is a great accomplishment. Well done!

Now here is the biggest secret I tell every single one of my students. From the best of them to the ones who struggle the most. This secret will make you the best writer you can be. **Here it is....."Do it again!"**
