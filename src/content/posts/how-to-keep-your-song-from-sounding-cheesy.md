  years, I have written a few cheesy songs myself. Let me show you some ways to
  make sure your songs aren't the next "Come on Barbie let's go party".

*How do I keep my song from sounding cheesy?* **Define what cheesy means to you and do the opposite of that. 1. Melody and beat. A great melody can overcome cheesy lyrics. 2. Subjective. Remember music is different for every listener. 3. Find a niche. Determine what niche best fits your style of writing. 4. Successful pattern. Listen to the great writers of your niche and follow their example.**



## **It's been stuck in my head for hours!**

It's the melody I tell you.**The catchier the melody is the less crucial the lyrics are.**Now look, don't tar and feather me yet. Let me at least explain what I mean.



Your brain can't filter through words as well when they're accompanied by music. Especially really catchy music. It seems to penetrate the brain's defenses like a knife through warm butter.



For lack of a better analogy, music is like a diversion that lets the lyrics sneak in undetected. Your filtering mechanism can only keep out one thing at a time and for some reason, music takes precedent in your brain.



The point is that the catchier the melody is the more "distracted" your brain will be from the words. This basically how songs get stuck in your head.



For example, If I started jamming "Come on barbie" right now, you would have a hard time not patting your foot or maybe even humming to the melody. Irrespective of the lyrics. 



I hate that song but I can't deny that the melody is catchy. When you accompany that melody with a great beat it's very hard not to get hooked. Just look at Djâ€™s and their mixes.



If the melody and beat are catchy enough, people will dance till they drop. If you couple that with enough repetition, you may have the workings of a number one hit despite the lyrics.



**I believe lyrics are important so don't get me wrong.** I appreciate a well-crafted song. However, I think many songwriters spend too little time developing a great melody in comparison to the amount of time they spend on their lyrics.



Don't forget that the melody is half of the song. It's very likely the half that will have people listening over and over whether your lyrics are cheesy or not.



## **The best of songs the worst of songs**

I think everyone has done the following; your friend calls up and says, "Hey man you have to listen to this new song!" So, reluctantly you listen and you hate it. You call up your friend and express your disgust.



Two weeks later you stop by to pick your friend up to give them a ride. As they open your car door, they're knocked to the ground by your speakers blaring that song you "hated". What happened?



Fickle is what happened. **We are so fickle when it comes to music.** We may hate it the first time we hear it but given enough repetition, we'll soon be arguing that the band uses the same kind of toothpaste we use.



We change our minds more than we change underwear. I hope we all change our underwear regularly anyway. Point being, what we love today we hate tomorrow and visa versa.



Even more than that, we all have different opinions or to say it another way, we all wear different underwear. Again, I hope we do. **Seriously, we all think differently when it comes to music.**



So what may sound cheesy to you may not sound cheesy to the next person. Also, people change their minds regularly. What they think is cheesy today may be what they want to be played at their funeral tomorrow.



You have to keep that in mind when you are writing. There are going to be those songs that you write, which people love, that you absolutely despise to perform.**Your opinion is just another pair of underwear.**



## **I still haven't found what I'm looking for**

**One thing that will really help you is finding a niche.** In most cases, we write our worst stuff when we venture outside our comfort zone into unknown territory.



I think we do this on purpose sometimes to prove something to ourselves. We may hear a really well-written song in a genre we don't typically write in and we get "inspired" to try it out.



Most times it's a miserable failure. There are rare occasions where a blind squirrel finds a nut but it seems to be the exception from my experience. It can be done but it is far more work than writing from your own niche. 



Now look, don't go nuts and accuse me of being narrow-minded. I do believe you can expand your niche to include other genres but you will find that comes best through collaboration and study over time.



If your niche is country music don't expect to hear a really well-written metal song and then be able to go out a write and equally good one yourself. Again, it's not impossible. It's just not likely.



Your niche is going to be really close to the music that you grew up with. The music that shaped your life. It may include a couple other genres but not many.**Your best music will always come from where you feel at home.**



If you want to expand your experience as a writer, then collaborate with someone who's niche is the genre you want to learn. This is the best way to get your education in different styles of writing.



**Studying the greats of any genre is also a good way to grow.** However, this takes time and practice. Like I said earlier don't expect to wake up one day and be a master in another niche without any time invested.



## **Don't re-invent the wheel**

**If you don't want your songs to sound "cheesy" then follow a proven pattern.**I still think cheesy is a relative term and that it's all probably in your head but I've already made a case for that.



I'm positive each one of your favorite songwriters thought their music was cheesy at one point or another. So go look at what they did. Listen to their melodies, syllables, structure, and tempo.



You can learn so much by learning how to dissect the songs of the artists you respect. If you want to learn how to do just that then check out my article**["5 exercises that will make you awesome"](https://mysongpro.com/posts/5-songwriting-exercises-that-will-make-you-awesome/)**



As you listen and begin to practice using the techniques and pattern they used, you may find that your music becomes less "cheesy" to you. I'm not convinced it was "cheesy" to begin with.



But we have to get you to a place where you believe in what you are writing. If not, you are doomed to sound like a "cheesy" hack. No one can remind you of your roots better than your favorite writers.



I remember back a long time ago I lost my way. **Every time I picked up my guitar to write, I would psyche myself out.** It finally got to the point that I walked away for a while. I think it was a year before I finally found my way back.



What ended up bringing me back was hearing a random songwriters panel on the public broadcasting network. As I sat and listened to the stories, there was a common theme. "I didn't expect people to like that song so much."



Those weren't the exact words of every writer that told their story but that was what they were saying in so many words. I watched that entire show without batting an eye.



I have since made it a regular habit to watch those types of things whenever I have the opportunity. Mostly because it reminds me that I'm not the only troubadour that faces the battle from time to time that my music is "cheesy".



It helps me to know that they pushed through their own personal insecurities to go on and share their work with the rest of us. What's more encouraging is that all of them say that they've had to look to their favorite writers for motivation as well.



**Find the resolve to dig deep and push through this moment in your songwriting career.**Go back and look at what you have learned from the greats and make sure that the problem isn't you.



Remember, your opinion is just one of many. Don't psyche yourself out like I did. Get a second opinion. Listen to your favorite writers over and over. Send it to me if you have to. I'll tell you what I think.



Dig deep and push through. **You got this.** I would love to hear it when it's finished. Well? I'm sitting here waiting for you to send it to me. Now go write it!
