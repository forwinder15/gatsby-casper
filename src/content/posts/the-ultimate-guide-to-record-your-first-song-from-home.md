I've been singing, songwriting, and recording "at home" for nearly 25 years now. Over that time I have learned a lot about what "not" to do and what "to" do. I want to share some of that knowledge with you so you can avoid some of the same mistakes.

_How do I get started recording from home?_ **Easy. Follow my step by step guide. 1. Space. You need a good place to record. 2. Computer vs. Multi-track. You need the right recording platform for your ability. 3. Microphones. You need the right microphone/s for your style. 4. Monitors & Headphones. You need the clearest playback from your output/s. 5. Instruments. You need good quality instruments. 6. Cables, Stands, & MISC. You need to buy the best equipment that you can afford. 7. Recording basics. You need to learn the simple tricks that will make you better and more efficient. 8. Practice. You need to make sure you are learning from each recording session.**

## **Lost with only a clue**

I have been right where you are, my friend. I remember standing in the middle of pro-audio at Guitar Center mulling over which one of the multi-track recorders I was going to drop \$1000 on. Yeah, they used to be pretty expensive.

Then there are microphones, stands, cables, speakers, headphones, and all the other stuff they want you to buy. It was pretty overwhelming once I realized just how much stuff you have to get started recording songs.

Even after all of my purchases, I still wasn't sure if I had made the right decisions. There were no "reviews" online to look at back then. I had to take it all home and figure it out. **Fortunately, you have me here to help guide you through this process.**

Now, I am going to endeavor to give you every ounce of wisdom I have but I don't want you to stop there. I want you to make sure that you use all the resources and info that is available to you out there. Why do I say that?

Because **my goal is that you will take the knowledge that I impart to you and build on it.** Use the tools and information I have provided as a foundation for your learning. Don't cap yourself off.

Having said that, we are going to cover the highpoints in this post so you've got a good idea of where to start. There is also a **YouTube video** of my personal setup. This will give you an idea of what a "practical" home studio looks like.

In addition to all of that, I have put together an in-depth version of this guide for you in my e-book **"Song Pro's Complete Guide to Recording Your First Song from Home"**. In it, you will find everything from what to buy to how to record your first song.

There are also some "tips and tricks" I've learned over the years tucked in its pages on something called**“Song Pro’s Recording Cheat Sheet”** which is **FREE** when you buy the e-book. Also, check the bottom of this post for a **special offer**. I hope that all these resources prove to be extremely helpful to you. Without further adieu let's get started helping you to get started recording.

## **Song Pro's Complete Guide to Recording Your First Song from Home**

## **1. Find the right space to record**

You wouldn't think it would matter so much where you set things up, would you? Well, it does matter. Very much and for several reasons. Here are a few reasons:

- **Comfort**
- **Convenience**
- **Acoustics**
- **Practicality**

Let's walk through one of these and see why this matters so much. I think you will be surprised at how much just one of these can affect the quality of your recordings.

**Acoustics**

We'll do this one since this is the one everyone gets kind of stuck on. This is actually a lot simpler than some people make it out to be. The first thing we have to do is get the "million-dollar" studio idea out of your head. That is not what we are going for.

**The best room in the house for acoustics is the spare bedroom where you keep all of your "crap".** If you are like me, this is the room that has a bed in it that's under a mountain of "yard sale" stuff that somehow never gets sold.

Don't clean it out! We want all of that stuff in there because it absorbs the natural "reverb" in the room. "Reverb" is the echo you hear from the sound bouncing off the walls. Your junk is achieving the same effect as the foam on the walls in the pro studio.

It interrupts the sound waves from bouncing back into your microphones when you are recording. That is exactly what we want. You can even go one step further and hang old blankets in the corners if you want.

The key is to get the "flattest" and clearest sound possible in your recording. You will be able to control the amount of reverb with your recording device much easier. Once you've recorded, what you have to work with is what you have.

**Tip alert! You can play around with your mic setup and your blankets to get different sounds.**

I cover this in more detail in the book as well as the other three points: "Comfort", "Convenience", and "Practicality". **All of these things matter greatly in getting the best quality sound out of your recordings.**

## **2. Which is better Software (DAW) or multi-track recorder?**

Well, that really depends on you. I know that's a frustrating answer for some people but it's true. It really depends on how much experience you have recording.

So let's pretend you have zero experience. My recommendation would be for you to get a multi-track recorder. "Why?" you ask. Because the learning curve tends to be lower than say a software (DAW) like "Protools" or "Cubase".

Now, there are programs like "Audacity" and "Garageband" which are more user friendly out the gate. However, you will need to have some basic computer skills, an understanding of the software you choose, and a few other pieces of equipment to get started.

A "good" multi-track recorder is pretty well a plug and play deal. They tend to have more of an "analog" setup which means you can actually touch the knobs and see the results as you make changes. In my opinion, that is the best way for a "newbie" to learn.

If you have some basic computer skills and a good understanding of how most software programs work, then starting with a computer may be a good fit for you. I will warn you though, there is a very steep learning curve with robust recording software.

If you buy something outside your ability before you've had any experience, you may spend more time learning to record than actually recording. I don't want you to become discouraged. There's plenty to learn without making it harder on yourself.

**My advice is to start simple and then upgrade your equipment as your knowledge increases.**If it's any encouragement to you, I've used all the platforms there are and I still use a multi-track recorder simply because I love how easy they are to operate.

I cover all the different platforms in the e-book. Including all of the pros, cons, specs, and price of each one. My product recommendations can be found in there as well.

## **3. Testing....one, two.....testing**

**Picking the right microphone is another important decision.** I told you earlier that once you've recorded, what you have to work with is what you have. Well, choosing the right microphone is a big part of that.

You will find that different mic's work for different people. That's one reason there are so many to chose from. Even more than that is that not all mics are created equal.

Directional, condenser, cardioid, omnidirectional. There are many different brands and paths to take but only a few are right for your setup. To find the right direction, we have to answer a couple basic questions:

- **What's your application?**
- **Where are you recording?**

Let's just look at your "Application" for now. This can be anything from recording audiobooks to putting together a full album. What mic you choose will depend on where you are in that spectrum.

For instance, if you are going to do a podcast and want to pre-record your commercials you may choose a "USB" or desktop condenser mic. On the other end, you may want "live mic" an acoustic guitar so you might need a good directional mic.

**Tip Alert! You need to be careful about choosing a mic solely based on what works best for someone else. Base your decision heavily on "specs" and "application".**

There is a full list of different microphones and their specs in the e-book. Including, my personal preferences and why those work well for me.

## **4. What you hear is what you get!**

How do you know you have recorded a truly "flat" take if your speakers and headphones don't playback a "flat" sound? That's a conundrum. It's not hard to avoid but it can be a pitfall if you don't take it into consideration.

So, what is "flat" sound? It's when the sound you record is the actual sound you are hearing through the speakers. Some speakers and headphones will add bass or treble to the sound that is moving through them simply because of how they are made.

We don't want that. When you are recording, you want to hear as close to an exact replication of what you have recorded in the playback. Otherwise, you do not know what you are working with. It's like flying blind in the dark.

Essentially, what will happen is that once you hear the "mastered" track played through your car speakers or your phone it will sound different. The "EQ" could have been a little out whack, the "reverb" wasn't loud enough, or the vocals sound "buried" in the mix.

**A great set of headphones and some good quality monitors will help you avoid some of this and get you a better mix.** Headphones especially. The "playback" is something you can not underestimate.

I cover a lot of the terms I used here in detail in the e-book. There is also a great product list of speakers and headphones for you to review in addition to my personal preferences.

## **5. The best guitar award goes to...**

I'm gonna do my best not to get on a soapbox so if I do my apologies upfront. This is a pet peeve of mine. Someone will likely disagree and that's fine. they are allowed to be wrong. Just kidding.

I'm going to say this again, what you record is what you have to work with. So logically the better sounding the instrument is the less work you have to do to make it sound good, right? Of course right. So don't buy junk.

I'm going to assume that you already have pretty decent instruments if you have decided you want to start recording at home. **If you do not have good instruments then you may need to pause the home studio until you do.**

Did I really just say that? Yes, I did. Here is why. If you have a crappy sounding acoustic guitar, then you are recording a crappy sounding guitar. No amount of effects changes that fact. Don't believe me?

Ok, let's stay with the guitar. If you have a piece of junk then you likely have trouble keeping it in tune, right? I am going to tell you that an instrument that won't stay in tune will make recording a nightmare for you.

Not only will you be endlessly re-tuning between takes but it will likely go out of tune in the middle of your take. If that happens it will make everything else sound out of tune. Including the vocals.

Many vocal issues have been resolved by switching to good quality instruments. There is a comprehensive list of quality instruments in the e-book, as well as, my opinions on what makes an instrument "good quality".

## **6. Don't cut the cable**

I have seen people time again try to use the purchase of their lesser items as a way to save some money. If you have got $1000 in the cart at this point, what is another $100?

Especially if having good quality cables and stand can save you time. You would be surprised how much time it takes just to record one song. You could spend as much as twelve hours in your studio and that's having quality equipment to work with.

Depending on how complex your track is, you could spend even more time than that. The last thing you want to do is waste a bunch of time-fighting with cables and stand to get them to work right.

**Your time is definitely more valuable than your money so don't waste trying to save a few bucks.** It is not worth your sanity and believe me it is the little things that will drive you nuts. Especially, when you consider all you have to learn about recording.

You want to spend time in the studio learning how to get the best take you can get. Not splicing shorted cables or taping your pop filter so it will stay in place. **Choosing the right equipment, in the beginning, will help you get more done in the end.**

I'm not gonna spend too much time on this here because I feel this is pretty self-explanatory. If you want a detailed list of my product recommendations, you will find them in the e-book.

## **7. Home studio recording basics**

So this is probably what you have been waiting on. This is my step by step guide and list of terms and best practices. These will help give you the jump start you are needing to get going in the right direction. Are you hit the "record" button for the first time?

### **Step 1. Set up your studio**

Depending on which platform you have chosen your studio setup may be a little different from this description so be sure to follow any instructions you have.

**1st** - Make sure your space is cleaned, organized, and ready for setup. If you have taken the time to make a draft or drawing of your setup, now is the time to get it out. Let's start putting things where they go!

**2nd** - Make sure you put your power supply somewhere easy to get to. You will want to make sure the power is switched off as you plug things up.

**3rd** - Now that you have everything where it goes, let's start plugging in your cables. Read the channel labels on your multi-track recorder or your preamp and make sure things are plugged into the corresponding inputs and outputs. The same goes for your monitors and headphones.

### **Step 2. Power on your recording equipment**

**1st** - You should have everything plugged in the proper place. Now would be a good time to glance over everything and peak at the instructions one last time to confirm all is well.

**2nd**- Once you've confirmed everything is as it should be, fire up the mothership. If you are doing this via computer, now would be the time to start your open your software. Each DAW will come with its own set of instructions so follow the ones for your program.

**3rd** - Make sure everything loads properly and that by all appearances things look to be working properly. If you are using software, you will want to make sure your program is set to receive the audio input from your preamp. You will also want to double-check that your outputs are set to send to your external monitors (If you've purchased them)

### **Step 3. Let's Record**

**1st** - Let's make sure we have sound. Grab a 1/4 jack cable and plug it into any input channel you wish. Make sure the gain for that channel is turned all the way down before you plug in the cable. Once you've plugged in slowly turn up the gain while tapping your finger against the exposed jack. You should see movement on the input display. We have a signal! Good job setting up.

**2nd** - Time to get plugged in. Turn you gains all the way down and find your instrument of choice. To "live mic" you will want to switch on the phantom power. There will be instructions with your device or software on how to do this. Again make sure your faders and gains are turned all the way down before you do this. Go ahead and plug in your mic and set it up in front of your instrument. If you are using a 1/4 jack simply use the cable you did to test for sound.

**3rd** - Pick any desired effects. Most software programs and some multi-track recorders will come with built-in effects that you can set to the input channels. If you would like effects, not is the time to pick the ones you would like. You can also follow the instruction to "record dry". This is where you will hear the effects as you record but the actual recording will have zero effects on it. This is so you may make adjustments later if you like.

### **Step 4. Time to record...**

**Studio Best Practices**

1. Studio setup - get your studio setup before you record.

2. Organized - keep your studio area organized to eliminate stress.

3. Clock in - always make a note of the time before you start each session.

4. Take breaks - don't burn yourself out. Getting some air can help your creativity.

5. Clock out - set a time limit on each session and make sure you stop when you've reached it.

6. No waste - Don't waste time brainstorming. Have an idea of what you're doing before you start.

7. In tune? - Tune your instruments before each session and re-check before each take.

8. Vocal warmup - warm up your vocals before recording and keep them warm between takes.

9. Save - make sure to save your progress occasionally as you record in case you lose power.

10. Clean up - put things back where they go at the end of each session.

## **Terms, Tips, and Tricks**

1. EQ…..

I have included the entire step by step process and the list of terms and best practices in the e-book. There are also some "tips and tricks" in this particular chapter that you will find very helpful.

Also, you will receive a **FREE** copy of **"Song Pro's Recording Cheat Sheet"** when you purchase the e-book. This quick reference guide is extremely handy to have when you are first learning to record.

## **8. Practice makes you better**

I hope that this gets in your blood. I have enjoyed many hours in my home studio recording the songs I have written. I've also shared some pretty special moments with my wife and my friends.

It's always a blast to gather around a microphone to create something that you know has the potential to bring a smile to someone's face and maybe change their life. Music is a powerful thing.

**I want you to be better at doing this than I am.** Some of you may already be there. If that's the case, I hope you will do your part in encouraging someone else. That's the thing I love about community. We can keep each other excited about what we do.

Now look, I'm a realist. I know that it will take some time and determination on your part to gain a mastery of these skills. There is so much more to learn than what I have included in the little e-book.

**My goal was to help you get started in the right direction.**If you get to a place where you have outgrown this resource then that means you are getting better. That's exactly what you want. We may grow but we must never stop growing.

There are tons of other great resources out there for you to look at when you get ready for them. Please don't hesitate to drop me a line and let me know if this was helpful to you or if you have any questions.

So I'm sitting here waiting to hear your next great song or piece of music. Now go write it and then record it!

Your friend,
