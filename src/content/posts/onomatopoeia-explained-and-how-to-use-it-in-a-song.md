*What is onomatopoeia and how do I use it?* **It's when you "smack" yourself cause you already know this. 1. BOOM! Words that make the sound they mean. 2. How? Use it to give life to a person, place, or thing. 3. Where? Put it where it has the biggest impact. 4. Practice. The more you use it the better you will get.**



## **"Go rockin' robin..."**

Have you figured it out yet? I'm sure you have. It's not too difficult of a concept, is it? Now, figuring out when, where, and how to use it in your songs takes a little bit of planning and practice.



Only a creative mind can come up with something that is catchy and manages to make sense at the same time. However, as I said earlier this is just another skill that needs to be developed like anything else with songwriting.



**Don't let onomatopoeia "spank" your butt.**"Bash" it down into submission. One of the best ways to do this is to listen to the work of other great songwriters who have used this principle.



For both our sake I am going to abbreviate "onomatopoeia" moving forward. I will use "**OP**" instead. My fingers are getting cramped typing that word.



One of the most popular songs of all time that used "OP" masterfully was "Rockin Robin" as performed by Bobby Day. I mean come on, you're already singing it in your head right now.



"Tweedilly-tweedilly-deet, tweedilly-tweedilly-deet, tweet-tweet-tweet-tweet"



They built an entire song around the intro of that song. Brilliant usage of "OP". You can do the same thing. It just takes some mastery of the English language and practice. Will get to that in a minute.



**A few more examples of good "OP":**

* "Ding dong the witch is dead"
* "Who let the dogs out? Woof woof woof"
* "Kris Kross'll make ya jump jump"
* "Old MacDonald had a farm ei ei o. With a...."



Old Mac is probably one of the best songs there is to help you wrap your mind around the whole idea of how "OP" is supposed to work in a song. You very likely learned the sounds of every barnyard animal there is because of Old Mac.



**"With an oink oink here and..."**

Would any kid in the world sing "Old MacDonald" if it didn't have all those animal sounds in it? Probably not. If you take out the animals all that's left is an old man with a farm full of "ei ei o's". Whatever those are.



Why am I taking you back to childhood? Because if you were like me as a child this is when you first learned about "OP" and how it works. Even if you didn't know what it was at the time.



You probably did what I did and made-up animals that didn't exist and created your own unique sounds for them. Everything from pig noises in place of chicken noises to the use of flatulence.



All that was left was to make them part of Old Mac's song and laughter would ensue for hours on end. You may be laughing at me right now if you didn't do this. That's ok. You get the point I think.



You want to use "OP" when it helps communicate the message of your song or if it makes the song more fun. Think about some of the rap and dance songs you know. Not all of which are appropriate.



However, they use this principle to get the audience involved. Even rock songs use it. AC/DC's "For those about to rock" comes to mind. Brain Johnson screams, "Fire!" and the cannon explosions nearly blow your speakers.



"OP" is a super-effective way to get people interacting with your music. **It's just gotta make sense**. As long as it fits into the theme and structure of your song, go for it.



## **"Oh, where is my hairbrush?"**

Never take for granted the power of well-timed "OP". Figuring out where to use it is like figuring out where the joke goes in the punch line. Wait. Reverse that.



It's all about timing and delivery. I've heard two different people tell the same joke with different results. One felt like he was standing there in his underwear and the other had everyone in tears.



Why is that? I know you've experienced this before. If you are going to use "OP" you have to work on your timing and delivery. If not you may feel like you're singing to the audience in your underwear.



For instance:

* "Who let the woof woof woof woof dogs out?"



Yeah, that doesn't work. Maybe you think that has to do with the fact that we already know how that song is supposed to go. If that's the case here's another example:



* "Down where the train whistle blows..."

Q: Where would the train whistle sound be most effective in this stanza?



If you guessed "at the end" you would be correct. This is an original that we decided to put a train whistle in after the word "blows". That's where it felt the most natural and had the best impact.



So listen to other songwriters and how they use onomatopoeia and see if you can duplicate that effect in your own songs. "Chew" on it a little before you "choose" where to use it. Onomatopoeia-pun. BOOM POW!



## **Practice makes perfect.**

Speaking of "puns", this is an excellent way to hone your timing and delivery. You have to learn to find different ways to use the English language to develop a mastery of it.



You don't need a master's in English. "Whack" me with a stick. Expand your vocabulary and then put it to practice. Use the new words you learn in conversation. Learn to tell a good joke well.



**If you claim to be a songwriter, then you have some responsibility here.** This really isn't something you can fake either. You will find yourself using the same phrases in every song if you don't do this.



So here's my suggestion to you. Take a song like "Wheels on the Bus" or "Old Macdonald" and return to your roots. This is gonna seem like a pretty goofy exercise but it works.



If you pay attention to kids, you will see that they have a knack for onomatopoeia. Somehow they understand exactly how to do it without having to understand it completely.



**God put music in us.** If you will get out of your own way, it will come out of you. We tend to overthink things and get ourselves in a funk if we're not careful. Don't think so hard and have fun.



The more you let go and start experimenting the easier this principal will get. That's one of the reasons you need to go back to your childhood songs.



**Onomatopoeia is about having fun in your music.** If you aren't having fun writing it, then people probably aren't going to have fun listening to it. Does that take some bravery on your part?



Sure it does. Nobody wants to be rejected or made fun of. I will say this. If you have a problem with what people think songwriting maybe a bullet that doesn't fit your pistol, my friend.



You don't want your song to go up in flames because you were too worried about the reaction. "Burn baby burn. Disco inferno. Burn baby burn."



Stop bobbing your head back and forth. See what I mean? Using "OP" makes the song super fun and interactive. If that is what you are trying to achieve then work on the things we've talked about.



So, “yakety yak don’t talk back” and get out there and write your next song using onomatopoeia. I waiting to hear it. **Now go write!**
