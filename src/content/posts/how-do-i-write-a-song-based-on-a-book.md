excerpt: I have read a lot of books and I have written a lot of songs. I suppose you
  could say I have written a lot of songs about books in 25 years.

How do I write a song about a book? **You need to read the book, summarize it in your own words, and then write it. #1 Read the book. If you don't know the material you will insult the author. #2 Summarize the book from your perspective. The author said what they had to say don't try to speak for them. #3 Go write it. Songs don't write themselves.**

## **Read the book**

I hope you have read the book. I will assume you have since you have asked this question. If you read the cliff notes then go read the book.

Nothing is more insulting to an author than someone who**misquotes**things that they say. I'm not talking about dropping a faux pa. I'm talking about misrepresentation.

If you aren't careful you could defame someone. What if you sat down and wrote a book about how much you love toilet paper, and then I came along and wrote a song about you saying toilet paper is of the devil?

You wouldn't like that. I think I have made my point. Read the book. Next to that would be a question I would ask myself if I were in your shoes:

Did this book impact me enough to write about it?

I'm going to assume that it did. Again, mostly because you asked the question. If that is, in fact, the case then you**need to consider**how it impacted you.

Why am I being so skeptical? Because if you felt this strongly about the topic you would have written the book yourself. "I'm not a writer," you say.

So you're "not a writer" wanting to write about someone's writing..... Ok, I'll go with that. Just make sure you are**super passionate**about this book before you do this.

Otherwise, you are just going to get into trouble. Now, I have an idea that maybe what you might have meant all along. How about writing a song about what's changed in your life as a result of this book?

That seems like a much safer and easier prospect. So now all you have to do is**READ THE BOOK**. I'm joking. We've established that you've read the book already.

What is next is to examine your life and what has changed as a result of this publication. Check out my article on "How to write a song about your life" for more info on this.

## **Your point of view**

Speak for yourself and from your perspective. Tell us how you've changed. Don't make any failed attempts at trying to speak for the author.

Unless the author calls you up and says, "Hey, dude. Will you write a song about my book?" don't do this. If I want to know what the author thinks I will buy their book.

Your song should be from your perspective. Why am I beating a dead horse on this? Because I know**no matter**how much I say this, people don't listen.

We love to weigh in and criticize everything in our lives with no consideration of the effects. However, when the shoe is on the other foot it's not cool, is it?

That may be the best way for you to approach this. Put yourself in the author's situation. If the author was going to write a book about your song what would you want him/her to say or not say?

Aaaah, it's a little different now. Now we are in a good spot I think. Maybe I was off base. Maybe I was a little too strong but you must consider you are wanting to write about another writer's work.

There is nothing wrong with it as long as it is from**your point of view**. That place is best found I think by summarizing how the book has changed your life.

Look at where you were before as compared to where you are now and start spilling the beans. This will probably be a very emotional song if I had to guess.

Go on and do it. Make me cry like a baby. I want you to. I love tearjerkers. The older I get the more sentimental I am. Nothing moves me personally like life experience.

Maybe your story is redemption. It might be humility. God forbid it was grief. If so, my condolences to you, my friend. Share your heart and you will find the book won't be the focus. You will be.

## **Now, go write it**

Here is the challenge and probably why you asked me this question in the first place. How do you start writing about this? Well, I have kinda already answered this.

**Start with you**. Write a letter or a page of how you have changed. You might even write a little story of your journey about where you were to where you are now.

It doesn't have to be super eloquent. Just be super honest. Vulnerability will get you "buy-in" or credibility with your audience. Nobody wants to be bs'd emotionally. We hate being jerked around.

That's one reason why I was so hard on you about reading the book. You can't**fake**your way into making a connection with people. All of us are guarded in this way.

I have to be able to trust you before I am gonna open up to you and that means you gotta be honest with me about how you feel and where you have been.

Take what I am saying**seriously**because people are gonna criticize your work no matter what. You better believe in what you are saying. You may just find yourself listening to your own message as a reminder.

If you don't believe what you are saying then why should anyone else? It takes guts to do this and my hat is off to all those who are brave enough to put themselves out there.

**Songwriters are a fearless breed.**You have to not care what people think of you to a certain degree. If you can't embrace that kind of a "loner's" existence then songwriting may not be for you.

Some of the best songwriters are the ones who have gone through some of the worst times you could imagine. More impressive is that they found a way to be real and open about it.

All of us who are listening have been strengthened by their bravery and courage to tell their story. We've been energized to go on and keep fighting.

No different than how the author of this book has made you feel. Now it's your turn to go make someone else feel the same way. So go write.

If you need a little bit of encouragement listen to some really emotionally heavy songs. "Whiskey Lullaby" is a great one to start with.

That song is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard and someone had the bravery to write. Don't just blow it off as "made up" either. The most powerful songs come from real-life experiences.

So like I said earlier go on and make me cry. I want to hear what you have to say. Tell me how your life was changed by someone who did what you are setting out to do.

I'm gonna give you just a little tidbit here about my personal approach to writing. This may be helpful to you as you attempt to pull from all areas of life for ideas.

I have written a bunch of songs about my life. Specifically about things I have struggled with. I talk a lot in my songs about those struggles and even the breakthroughs, but I never mention the books I've read.

That would be a little awkward, wouldn't it?... "I've got scars on my hand, on my feet, on my face, I believe it's because I read Boundaries.." (original)

That is the part of the "story behind the song". I am pretty guarded about some of that stuff too just because it's the nature of things.

As vulnerable as songwriting makes you is it gives you limited exposure. We can expand this in another article for sure. However, I have a friend who puts this thinking well....

**"Always tell the truth, just not the truth always"**

Just because you are being honest doesn't mean you have to tell everybody how much you paid for it. Keep somethings between you and God where they belong. Now go write.
