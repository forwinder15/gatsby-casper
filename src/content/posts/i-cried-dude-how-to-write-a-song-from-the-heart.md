  you mean it.

*How do I write a song from the heart?* **Simply share how you feel. 1. Meditate on how you feel. Take an inventory of your feelings. 2. Be honest with yourself. The more vulnerable you are the more powerful it is. 3. Write it down in as few words as possible. Summarize. #4 Sing it. Let's hear what you have to say.**



# **Think on that thingâ€¦.**

If you don't know how you feel then how am I suppose to? I bet you know exactly how you feel. It's being able to express it that's difficult, right?



Let's try to unpack it in a way that isn't so intimidating. For starters, let's forget about writing a song for now. I want you to focus on something you are passionate about.



I don't care if it's **bubblegum and ice hockey.** Just focus on whatever it is that fires you up. Chances are your wood just a little wet and you need someone to stoke you.



Now if you are the type that says, "I'm not passionate about anything," I'm afraid I can't help you. Mostly because you aren't telling the truth. Everybody is passionate about something. Find it and focus.



So, now that you got your focus on something that **fires you up**, I want you to imagine Amazon is asking you to write a review about it. Aaaaah, we are getting close, aren't we?



I would wager you just wrote 7 sentences in your head before you read this sentence I typed. You found your fire. Now, let's take hot coal off this fire and throw it on what you want to write a song about.



How do we do that? Easy. **Answer this question:** Why are you so passionate about your favorite thing? How do you feel about that hobby, job, person, God, etc?



Does that particular passion of your make you feel happy, sad, angry, excited, fulfilled, joyous, satisfied, desperate, anxious? If it is indeed your passion you have probably felt all of these at some point.



Now it's time to think about the **"subject"** you want to write about and how it has affected your own life. Have you grown? Have you been hurt? What did you learn? Are you angry, sad, happy, or depressed?



Am I making sense? **Are you seeing a trend?** See if you can find similarities between what you absolutely love and what you want to write about. If you haven't done this before you may feel a little silly.



Just go with it and trust me this works. What you are doing is called "empathy" or "sympathy". For the sake of time, it simply means putting yourself in the shoes of another.



## **You can't fake it!**

Now that you have a good grasp on how to identify with the subject you want to write about, you have to get really honest with yourself about your feelings.



You can't fake your way through trying to write from the heart. I have seen this tried and I think you have to. It just doesn't work.



There is an **incredible** emotional connection that happens when you listen to "heart-felt" songs. You have to be really vulnerable at the very least just to be able to listen to these songs.



You are going to have to get way more vulnerable as the writer. I would say, with confidence, that people are really guarded about their emotions. you have to when their trust.



As a general rule expect to be **twice as vulnerable** as your intended audience if you want to make that connection. At the end of the day that connection is what we are after, right?



You have something you want to say about something you are passionate about and you don't just want people to listen you want them to break down like babies and cry with you as you sing your heart out.



I've said this before, **it takes fearlessness to be a songwriter** and this is what you have set out to do. As you think about how honest you are willing to be let me give you something to stew on.



People are likely to criticize you no matter what you write. You got to decide which one you would rather be criticized for: A good heartfelt song, or something less than what you're capable of?



Does this scare the **"baby Yoda doo doo"** out of you? Good. It means you respect the heart of songwriting which is writing from the heart.



Have you decided what you are gonna write about yet? Well, what are you waiting for? I need to hear something that makes me cry. Get on with it!



## **Say what you mean to say**

Wait! Before you go, think about this. Don't give me too much information. What do I mean? Don't put me to sleep with all your boring details. Get to the point.



**Now, don't go too far.** Don't sing me ten choruses of "I love you.....baby" I'm changing the channel. I need some context. I need to know about the hundred miles you swam to get to me just not all one hundred.



Move me with your love and how far you've come. Don't tell me about every single one of the ninety-nine bottles of beer on the wall. I will find you and smack you (joking).



**You have a tremendous potential** to change the world with your message. So don't screw it up by not getting to the point. You've got 3.5 minutes on average before you lose the audience.



Some will argue, producers mostly I might add, that you've got about 45 seconds. This is all best guess. **Music is so subjective** and no one really knows why some people listen to certain things.



If I sit and told you all my favorite types of music it would make your head spin. Maybe not. You are probably just as diverse in your likes and dislikes.



However, if I told you all the types I like to write then **you might look at me weird**. We are all different in the way we interpret and the way we share our message.



Just make sure you say what you came to say before you get off by either a lack of interest or patience. Some people are begging you to share your story but they will only give you so much time.



You gotta get to the point of this thing here. It's not real complicated. Simply write it down in long-form. Read it. Summarize in about seven sentences then structure it into a song.



## **Sing like no-one's listening**

Let's hear what you have. Oh, you only have words? Well, what melody do you hear in your head? You know how to hum, right?



**Start humming.** If you got a favorite song or something that you would like your song to sound like hum that. Change it a little, put your lyrics to it, and you are in business.



No matter what you read out there songwriting is not rocket science. I can teach you everything you need to know right here on this site in an afternoon of reading.



What I can't teach you how to make yourself go do it. **20% head knowledge and 80% behavior.** You have to sing it to me if I'm going to hear it.



You have to know what you want to say before I can tell you what I think about it. If I write your song for you then it's not your song it's mine.



You can do this. I believe in you. That comes from the heart. Am I making a connection with you? Do you feel like I really care about your music and your songs?



Good. Because I really do. You see when you really mean people will know. **Do you believe in what you are writing about?** I'll know when you sing it to me.



You call yourself a songwriter so show me. I believe you are a songwriter. That's why you are here. I don't think you came here just to figure out how to write form the heart.



I believe you came here because you need somebody to believe in you, my friend. Well, you got it. I believe in you. The question is: Do you believe in yourself?



So, I will sit here and anticipate the day you send me what you've been working on. I can't wait to feel what you've felt and what you've lived through the heart of your song. **Now go write it!**
