## **Tip 1. Finish the song**

Man, this is the biggie. I can't tell you how many songwriters I have worked with who have the potential to be the next Willy Nelson or Ed Cash but they will never get there because they don't finish their songs! **We will never be able to listen to a song that doesn't exist.** Make yourself sit down and finish the song!

## **Tip 2. You should be you**

Another big mistake songwriters make is getting away from what they are good at. I'm telling you right now that you will regret all the time you wasted on trying to achieve your "zen" while songwriting. **Find your identity early on and stay true to that.** You are the best you there is. Don't try to be something you are not.

## **Tip 3. Necessary endings**

We all have that one song that beat us. Like a pebble in our shoe, it drives us nuts but instead of sitting down and getting rid of the pebble we try to wiggle our foot around till we can't feel it anymore. Worse, we keep walking convinced that it magically isn't there anymore. Then suddenly a sharp pain in our heel nearly brings us down! Listen to me. **Embrace the failure, reckoning how crappy the song was, and move on with life.**

## **Tip 4. Write it down**

If you are like me, you have lived to regret not writing down or recording a great idea that you've had. Who knows how many songs have been lost by either our lack of preparedness or stubbornness. Make it a habit to carry a notebook with you or use the memo app on your phone to **capture those ideas that appear one minute and are gone like a vapor**. Don't live to regret making this mistake.

## **Tip 5. Share it with someone**

If God has put this gift in your life you are almost obligated to share it. You may never know the number of lives you could affect for the good by sharing what God has blessed you with. Even if your songs are about pain, suicide, or abuse. **Someone's life may be saved as a result.** We will never know if you don't share your work with us.

## **Tip 6. Believe your message**

This is huge. **If you don't believe what you are saying why should anyone else?**Nothing is quite as sad to me as to stand and watch someone, who is on stage feeling the pressure of being in front of people they don't know, deliver a fake performance. You can see through the audience's lack of response that they know it wasn't genuine. People are smart. You can't fool them into believing you if you don't even believe you.

## **Tip 7. From the heart**

Right next to believing in yourself is writing from the heart. This will change your writing. What's really cool is that no matter where you are in life you can write from the heart and not worry about the same songs coming out over and over. Life changes and we change with it so your songs will follow. It's a terrifying prospect to be this vulnerable but nothing else will touch another hearts like your heart. **Check out "How to write a song from the heart"**

## **Tip 8. Find your niche'**

You can't stay in your comfort zone if you don't know what that is. I have found that most often our niche is the type of music we enjoy. Our writing tends to gravitate towards the styles and genres that have helped shape and mold our own lives and memories. It is possible to have more than one genre you enjoy writing but you need to know what your go-to niche is. That will be where your best work is done because that is home.

## **Tip 9. Keep working on it**

There is a fine line between letting a bad song die and giving up on something that's giving you a little trouble. Your neighbor's house is on fire. Do you die trying to save him or let him die because that's his problem? You do everything you can until you can't do anything else. Do not give up so easily. There are tons of things you can do to tackle your problem. **Check out "Why is songwriting so hard? How to get past songwriterâ€™s block"**

## **Tip 10. Do not isolate**

Life is not done in a vacuum and neither is songwriting. You may be missing out on tons of ideas and opportunities to write because you're isolating from others. **Cutting yourself off from people will stifle your creativity eventually.** I write more and I write better when I am hanging around other songwriters regularly. You will keep each other sharp and you may just learn something new.

## **Tip 11. Get a second opinion**

Wait. Stop. Don't. Before you release that new idea on stage or spend hours recording it, get a second opinion. I can't tell you how much time my inner circle has saved me by letting me know that my new genius idea isn't so genius. Nothing is worse than the person who thinks that their ugly baby is beautiful and keeps asking everyone else, "Isn't he/she beautiful?" **Stop! You're making everyone lie to you.** Get the opinion of someone you will listen to first before you share it with the world.

## **Tip 12. It has to make sense**

Speaking of ugly babies, I dread having to tell someone their song doesn't make any sense. Nobody wants to hear that. Not even me. We know exactly what we are trying to say but for some reason every time we open our mouth fish falls out. If you are having trouble expressing yourself well, check your structure, take an emotional inventory, and ask for help if necessary. The song obviously means a lot to you. **Make it say what you feel not what's hip.**

## **Tip 13. Flip flop it**

About 90% of the time I can fix any writing problem I am having by flip-flopping the structure of the song around. Sometimes it is as simple as just moving verses around. Try singing the verse as the chorus and visa-versa. You might even consider changing your bridge to the chorus and the chorus to the bridge. **Experiment.** After all, it's your song.

## **Tip 14. Back up your work**

As important as it is to write things down it is equally important to back it all up. I transfer my lyrics to the computer every so often and back them up on an external hard drive. That way if disaster ever strikes I have only lost the most recent songs which are generally logged in my memory anyways. It's gonna rain. Have an umbrella.

## **Tip 15. Fun hard**

Some people write for money(professionals). Some write for pure expression(artists). Others have fun. I think the middle between the two extremes is where creativity thrives because we all want to get paid to do what we love. If you don't find balance between the two extremes no one will want to work with you because nothing is ever good enough for you.**Have fun and if you have fun hard enough you might make money doing it.**

## **Tip 16. Hit the reset button**

Sometimes it is good just to take a break. Even people who love what they do for a living take a vacation to unwind and relax. Don't burn yourself moving from one song to the next. If you stop and recharge your batteries every once in a while you will surprise how much better the machine will run when you fire it back up.

## **Tip 17. Write with a great writer**

As good as it is to spend time in the company of other songwriters sharing your songs and listening to theirs, nothing beats actually writing with someone else. Especially someone better than you. There will never be a time where you will learn more than when you are actually writing with a better writer. They are out there. Find one and work with them if you can. Make sure to take notes(pun intended).

## **Tip 18. Hone your skills**

Nobody is ever done learning. Make sure you are pursuing knowledge constantly. It's been said that the most successful people read at least one book a month. I don't know if this is possible for your situation but at the very least follow several threads or blogs that talk about all things songwriting.

## **Tip 19. Learn an instrument**

If you already play an instrument go learn another one. You never know when that skill will come in handy. Besides, it may just put you one step closer to becoming the singer-songwriting-producer-engineer that puts outnumber one hit songs every year. I suggest guitar or piano for the songwriter aspiring to be a musician. **Learning an instrument will super-charge your writing creativity.**

## **Tip 20. Sing to yourself**

"Sing to yourself in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs making melody unto the Lord." Making melody constantly will bring new ideas to you. If you can't play, sing. If you can't sing, hum. If you can't hum, whistle. No excuses here. You should be creating as many melodies in your head as you do lyrics. **Good melodies are the feet that will take your songs to places you never dreamed.**

## **Tip 21. Studio time**

Find the closest professional studio to where you live and make a day of it. The people there would be happy to give you a guided tour. Tell them you're a local songwriter looking for a good studio. You will learn exactly what it takes to create a professional sounding Album and EP. This will give you some exposure to the production side of the music industry. 

## **Tip 22. Test, test, test**

If you are recording at home, make sure to pick the right microphone for your voice. You are going to have to do some shopping and comparing to find out which one is best suitable for you. I am assuming that you are singing your own songs so keep that in mind. If you don't plan to sing your own songs then just buy something quality to get you by. The idea is to get your songs down so the studio artists can re-create it.

## **Tip 23. Hire it done**

If you can't sing like a pro then the chances are you need to have a studio band and vocalist do your EP. It's ok to do your own "demos" in your home-studio but this isn't gonna be good enough to get other people to take you seriously. **It's basically gonna have to be good enough to be on the radio without help to get help.** Yes, I think that is stupid but it's the nature of the beast.

## **Tip 24. Multi-track recorder**

I think a good multi-track recorder is the best way for any songwriter to go. Some writers out there can't seem to live without their 10k home-studio. I think that is insane myself. Especially if you plan on selling your songs to someone else. Now if you are the prodigy who can do-it-all including performing it like the pros, then go for it.**That's not likely the case for most of us though.**

## **Tips 25. Quality buy**

If you are going to buy equipment or instruments make sure you buy quality. That doesn't mean you have to buy the most expensive things out there. Just make sure it's made well and does what it is supposed to do. Check the customer reviews and shop around. Don't go to the local Guitar Center and buy the first thing the kid in pro-audio said to buy. What's best for them is not always best for you. **Do your research!**

## **Tip 26. Keep it in tune**

Nothing is quite as annoying as having that one spot in your song where something is off-key. You can try to ignore it but it isn't going away. trust me. You can solve this by simply making sure you tune your instruments between every take. That may seem excessive but you will be glad you did it when you are trying to mix everything down.

## **Tip 27. Getting a flat part 1**

Ever tried recording your vocals a thousand times only to sound flat on every take? The answer can be as simple as the previous tip. Tune your instruments between takes. If that doesn't help, it may be the mix in the headphones. If you aren't loud enough, you will tune to your head voice or bone voice. Make sure the playback mix is set right.

## **Tip 28 Getting a flat part 2**

Something else you can try to fix-a-flat is to take one side of the headphones off and cup your hand around the back of that ear so you can hear your front voice better. Some vocalists prefer this method better. They feel they can tune their voice better. The trick is you have to make sure the mix is loud enough that they can tune their voice to the music.

## **Tip 29 Getting a flat part 3**

The placement of the microphone can affect the tone of your voice as well. You need a crash course in engineering basics. There are several great articles out there on different microphone placements. The trick is to place the microphone where you can sing comfortably without straining and then tune it so you can hear yourself above the mix without drowning out the music.

## **Tip 30 Getting a flat part 4**

Last one. Practice makes perfect. Sometimes we try every technique know to man to convince ourselves we aren't flat when in reality we are flat. If you keep doing vocal takes you are going to get better at recording your voice. You will be able to better distinguish between your front voice and bone voice. This can get maddening. Just remember, with every take you are learning what works and what doesn't.

## **Tip 31. The perfect take**

You have to ask yourself if you are going to perform your own songs or not. If not then you better be real careful about getting sucked into capturing the perfect take. No matter if it's vocals or music, this is an easy trap to find yourself in. If you are a prodigy who does it all then make sure it's radio worthy. If you are like me just make sure the studio artists can easily interpret what you are trying to accomplish. **It doesn't have to be perfect.**

## **Tip 32. Keep it clean**

This will sound stupid to some of you, but having a messy studio will discourage you from working. Your space needs to be organized and inviting. Make sure you leave time for yourself to clean up after you are done recording every time. This will make sure the next time you have time to record you don't change your mind because of the mess.

## **Tip 33. Get a metronome**

Nothing is quite as bad as trying to listen to a good song being sung way offbeat. It always makes me want to take the instrument away from a person in frustration and play it for them while they sing it. Get a metronome or set up a click track on your recorder. You have to do this if you are recording without exception. Most multi-track recorders have a built-in metronome. Staying on the beat is music 101.

## **Tip 34. Sing it like no one is listening**

Sometimes the passion can get lost in efforts to get everything just right on a vocal take. It is only going to be as good as the passion you sang it with. **Get your mind where it needs to be before you record.** Concentrate on the heart of the song and imagine yourself singing it to a crowd of people who actually like your voice. Sing it like you mean it.

## **Tip 35. Stop that dancing**

If you want to dance to your song do it after your vocal take. Don't dance while you are trying to record. Send that energy t your fingertips or lightly par your foot. **Maintaining the right distance from the microphone can make or break your vocal.**Now that can be a tough balance between singing with passion and not moving around. You have to find it though. A vocal that bounces all over the place is a nightmare to mix.

## **Tip 36.Lost in the mix**

You have done everything to get a great mix but you can't hear everything clearly. What are you gonna do? Before you reach for the EQ and screw everything up try using the PAN to move the mix around the room. Imagine all the parts are on stage playing together. Use the PAN to put them in their respective places. **You will be amazed at how much this will clear up the mix.**

## **Tip 37. Producer vs Songwriter part 1**

You've been in the studio for a week trying to make this song sound perfect. You haven't written anything new in all that time. Question: Do you plan to become a professional producer? It's fine to enhance your songs but don't forget to create new songs or you may just run out of material to work on. This is the trap I keep telling you about.

## **Tip 38 Producer vs Songwriter part 2**

Again, make sure you are balancing your studio time with how much time you spend writing new songs. There are many times where a new idea has helped me enhance a song I was working on recording. Don't get sucked into the trap of trying to make your demos perfect. After all, unless you're a prodigy you are going to have to hire a studio to get the EP done.

## **Tip 39. Work-for-hire**

You are looking for a studio that will record your demo for a set amount of money. **Do not share royalties with a producer if you can avoid it.** You stand to make cents on a dollar as it is if your music is sold so donâ€™t cut your own legs out from under you before you get started. There are plenty of producers and studio owners that will do work-for-hire.

## **Tip 40. Perform your song**

Get on stage and rock it out, man. We all want to hear your new stuff. Find yourself a local coffee house that does an open mic night and share your work. That live stage performance will make you better every time. It also gives you a test audience of peers that will be less harsh if they criticize you at all. A few of these folks will even come alongside you and encourage because they know it takes guts. **Go for it!**

## **Tip 41. Sing it the same**

This is gonna sound boring and some of you may disagree but hear me out. Sing it the same every time. You know what I mean. Don't be that songwriter who's songs sound the way a Picasso painting looks. The more you sing it over and over the more comfortable you will get it with. Think about this, if you keep changing it every time you sing it maybe it isn't that good. You may need to work on it some more. **If you don't like it enough to sing it the same way every time why should anyone else?**

## **Tip 42. Categorize your songs**

I saw a guy do this a long time ago and I've been doing this since. Keep an organized portfolio of your songs. Instead of putting them in alphabetical order put them into categories. I like to organize mine by genre. I still keep them in alphabetical order inside each genre, but it helps me to better find something if I'm looking for a certain type of song.

## **Tip 43. Get a Copyright**

The cost of to copyright your stuff is pretty inexpensive if you do it upfront. If you wait until you get into a court battle the costs can be astronomical. In this day in age, it's pretty hard to steal anything because of the timestamps on files but you can spend a fortune trying to prove you owned it first.

## **Tip 44. Pass it on**

There is nothing quite like teaching the craft of songwriting to the next generation. Shoot, teaching anybody is fun really. If you can find a student that's interested in learning what you know don't pass that up. **Anyone can write.** You never know what you may learn by teaching them.

## **Tip 45. Rhyme and Alliteration**

As dorky as it may sound, having a dictionary and a thesaurus is a great idea. Broaden your vocabulary and hone your slang. A sign of a good songwriter is being able to say the same thing in five different ways without being boring. Captivating your attention with their command of language until you wake up and realize you've just heard the same message again. Like I did to you just now like I did to you.

## **Tip 46. Listen to your favorites**

If you can't get around better songwriters then listen to them as much as you can. Everyone has that favorite artist and probably a favorite song. Find out who wrote it and listen to the other stuff they have written. I would encourage you to find several otherwise the temptation is to mimic the only one you listen to. If you have three or four to pull the best from you will find your own voice.

## **Tip 47. Parody like a parrot**

One exercise I do that gets me a little bad attention from my friends is parody. I like to replace lyrics in every song I hear. It's mostly for fun and typically I do it to poke fun but it does help me stay sharp. It will also speed you up. I picked this idea up from an improv comedy show I enjoy watching and it has really helped me keep from getting stuck over the years.

## **Tip 48. Read quotes**

Summarizing what you want t say is the essence of songwriting. I would say that most songs that lose me are the ones who lose the heart the song by trying to say too much. Boil it down to the simplest thing and then sing it. **Reading quotes is a great exercise for getting better at summarizing.** You may even get a song idea or two from reading.

## **Tip 49. Music theory basics**

So I put this one way down on the list for a reason. That's where I think it belongs. Don't start out trying to learn the basics of music theory. You can pick this up as you learn more about playing an instrument. It's not complicated either. Don't listen to the stuff-shirts who think music theory is essential. **Chances are you already know enough to start.** Just go write. I can learn theory basics in fifteen minutes.

## **Tip 50. Write, write, write**

Nothing will keep your creative juices flowing like writing. Just write it down and finish it. If you get stuck, push through. If the song is dead, bury it and move on. **The key is not to give up.** Keep writing. Even if you write the next number hit, write again. I can't tell you how many times I have taken two song ideas and put them together to create a good song. Keep writing. Keep writing. Keep writing.
