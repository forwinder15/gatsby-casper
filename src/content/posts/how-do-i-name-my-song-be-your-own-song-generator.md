excerpt: Naming a song seems like a very obvious and simple thing to do but
  sometimes it can be a little difficult. Some would say this is an art unto
  itself and that you can spoil your "zen" if you don't listen to the "song
  gods".

Others say it will determine whether your song "makes it big" or not. Like somehow your song won't sell as good if the name isn't perfect. I think that we need to take a breathe and calm down.

Picking a name for a song can be done without having an anxiety attack. There's a few things you have to remember when you're doing this. Let me show you.



*How do I name my song?* **Simple. Name your song what you want to name it. 1. Consider your options. There are different ways to name a song. 2. Names mean what they mean. Your name should embody what you are trying to say. 3. Check your motive. Business or pleasure. 4. Get help. Sometimes good feedback can help resolve your dilemma**



## **Names, names, names**

There's a lot of different way to come up with a mane for your song. Everything from speed thinking to breaking out the Ouija board. I've said it before, you don't have to worship the devil to write great songs.



Naming songs is not an exception. You just need some practice and little bit of practical guidance. I've listed eight different options below that I think will really help you become your own "Song Generator".



## **Option 1. Reboot the "idea"**

Make sure your song is finished. I harp on this all the time and I'm gonna do it again. Finish your songs. A song with lots of flaws is the same as a half-baked song. It's unfinished. It's very hard to name an unfinished song.



If this is the case, go back to your original idea. See if you have ventured away form your original theme into the woods. If you have, find your way back to the path. This may clear up your "name" dilemma

## **Option 2. Start before you start**

Maybe the reason you are having trouble naming your song is because you didn't name it to start with. I find it a great practice to name the song by it's idea or theme before I start writing. Typically, I end up staying pretty close to that original thought.



Naming the song first will help you keep from getting lost along the way as well. You can always decide to go a different route once you're done. Just don't violate the idea behind your song by trying to be too abstract.



## **Option 3. Use the chorus**

This is a pretty standard practice in the music industry. Sometimes we can get into trouble trying to "re-invent the wheel" if we aren't careful. If your song has a really catchy chorus it may be the best thing to simply name your song "that".



The chorus is likely how people are going to remember your song anyway. How many times have you searched for a song you couldn't remember the "name" of? What did you do? You put the "chorus" in the search bar.



## **Option 4. Get a second opinion**

If you've decided that you can't come up with a name for your song, let someone give you feedback. After all, you are wanting other people to be impacted by the song, aren't you? See what they think.



Now look, don't use this as a cop out to avoid being responsible for your own work. It's not everyone's job to do your job. However, if you get in a jam or you hit "the wall" this is a viable option.



## **Option 5. This song is dedicated...**

There are definitely times when a dedicated title makes sense. We have all had those events happen to us which have shaped and molded our lives. Simply name your song in dedication to whatever or whoever it was.

For example:

* "Mom's Song"
* "Jennie, Jennie, Jennie"
* "The ballad of/A song for \_\_\_\__"(name)
* "(A town name)"
* "911" (significant historical event)
* "Christmas" (holiday)



In some cases it may be a god idea to get permission first. Some folks can be a little finicky about having something dedicated them. Especially, if they don't want to date you!



## **Option 6. The unspoken word (theme)**

I think this is the one people start after that gets them lost. Jack Johnson's "Flake" is a great example of naming a song by it's unspoken theme. If you listen to his lyrics you'll hear his song title without hearing his song title.



This takes some careful planning and clever lyric writing. Think of it kind of like a dictionary. The trick is to write the lyrics using the definition of the word without using the word itself.



## **Option 7. The one liner**

Next is the "one liner". The most obvious example of this to me is "Tears in Heaven" by Eric Clapton. Much like option 6, this takes careful planning and clever writing.

There's really two ways to do this:

1. After you write the song - pick the most impactful line in your lyrics regardless of where they are in the song structure.
2. Before you write your song - boil your theme down to the most powerful quote or "one liner" you can think of. Include that phrase in your lyrics where it will have the greatest impact.



## **Option 8. The odd ball**

I'm going to caution you here. Don't be too abstract. Just like a great song title won't rescue a crappy song, a freaky weird one won't help either. As a general rule, "Eat flies, we all come from frogs" is pretty weird for a song title.



However, "I am the walrus" is pretty weird too. So, find some balance here. Remember, if the song sucks the title won't matter. "I'm am the walrus" is a cool song, in my opinion, and the title is appropriate for the song's theme.

## What's that supposed to mean?

You might have picked up on this already but I'm not a fan of extremes. What I mean is that you have to learn balance when you are writing. Otherwise you're gonna drive yourself nuts.



Any time I've sat down with someone who's having trouble naming a song, we've usually got it solved in a matter of minutes. In most cases they are just thinking too hard.



Names mean what they mean. Take "Flake" for instance. Jack's song reflects exactly what the word flake means. All he did was find a really creative way to say what he meant. It isn't complicated.



**Ask yourself a few basic questions:**

* What am I trying to communicate
* Who am I trying to reach?
* How do I feel about this song?
* What are my intentions for this song?



Answering these question will probably solve the issue. You are probably just over thinking. I would be willing to bet that if your stuck it's because you've ventured away from the theme of your song.



If you can find a way to get out of the way you may find the right way to name the song. What's the right way? Let the song name itself. Whoa, it just got weird.



Not really. It's simply what I've been describing. The theme of your song will point you in the right direction. If you go back to the original idea you had you will find the name waiting on you when you get there.



## **The reason we get lost**

Lack of balance. That's the reason we get lost. Songwriters tend to go through periods of righteous indignation about their work. When this happens you've lost balance.



So here's what I mean. There are really **three** schools of thought on writing songs.

1. **Professional** - this mindset looks at songwriting as purely a business. The goal is to sell records and lots of them. No more no less.
2. **Artist**- this mindset looks at songwriting as purely an expression of who they are. The goal is to achieve their "piece de resistance" before they die. No more no less.
3. **Professional/Artist**- This is the mind set that looks at songwriting as something to express themselves and make money at if they can. They do it simply because they love it. No more no less.



You are one of these three. If you are like the rest of us, you will waffle back and forth in your career between the three.**Balance is work for every songwriter.**



Before you go nuts and hang me by my toes allow to explain why I believe this. Over the years, what I have discovered is that "stuck-ness" is usually caused by stubbornness.



Now, there is a good kind of stubbornness which causes us to push through the hard times, however, there is a bad kind of stubbornness as well. The kind that causes us to dig in and refuse to learn, listen, and change.



That "bad" stubbornness is what contributes to getting stuck. Not the kind of stuck that takes a little bit of "digging in". I'm talking about the kind of "stuck" that kills a song.



Sometimes we decide that a particular song "has" to be about "expression" and being an artist. "I don't care if people like it or not. I'm not changing it. That song means too much to me." Sound familiar?



Then there are times when we get to ridged and turn into drill sergeants. "That won't work. It has to have three verses, 3 choruses, and a bridge to be a good song. That's what sells records!"



Look, there's nothing wrong with selling records. We all want to make money, right? We just don't want to get caught in a trap that causes us to forget why we started writing in the first place.



There's absolutely nothing wrong with expression and the art of a well crafted song either. But nobody wants to be that unheard of troubadour who never got his shot because he wouldn't listen to feedback.



**Getting lost has happened to us all at some point.** That's why I tell all of my students, "Figure out who you are early on and don't forget it!" There will come a time when you need a reminder.



I told you earlier that balance takes work. If you wake up and find you're in stucksville, ask yourself if you are being too ridged or too expressive. Chances are it's one of the two.



To find your way back to balance just go in the opposite direction you've been going. Simply put, if you are writing a song just to sell it and you get stuck lean back towards being more artistic.



If you are writing a song just to express yourself and you get stuck lean back towards being more professional. You definitely want to get paid if you can. If people can't relate they won't buy it.



It's the same with being professional. If you spend your whole career writing cookie cutter songs to sell records you might wind up hating songwriting. **Fun and creativity thrives in the balance.**



## **Call in the troupes**

I mentioned this in passing before but I want to end here. Mostly because, I think this is a key way to find balance and maintain it. Every time I start wondering away from who I am as a songwriter, my circle jerks me back.



**You have got to find yourself a troupe of writers to meet with regularly.** This is such an essential part of not only achieving balance but also being a great songwriter period.



Think back to the days of Johnny Cash, Elvis, Hank Williams, Ray Charles, and others. Most of the great professional/artists traveled together. A lot the ones today do as well.



Why is this so important? Because most of all those great songs came from their collaborations or feedback to one another. Aah, "I see said the blind man."



We do our best work in community. **God did not design us to be, live, or work in isolation.**That's why solitary confinement is a punishment and not a reward.



Some people would say that the internet has made us less connected and I would agree if we are only talking about face to face.



However, YouTube, Facebook, and the like have actually given us the opportunity to meet and share with people that we would otherwise never have met.



Seriously, you are reading this article as a result of the internet. I hope it is helping you in some way to become a better songwriter. That's the power of community.



So you're stuck on what to name your song, right? Well, if you have a troupe you meet with then you can get their feedback. They may even be able to help you with some of the rough spots.



Now, I know that take vulnerability. It also takes balance. You have to be willing to receive feedback that you're being too expressive or too ridged. After you get over being butt hurt, listen to your peers.



What do you have to lose? If it doesn't work you are no worse off than you are right now, are you? You might just come out of the deal with a number one hit that you absolutely love to sing.



A good thing to keep in mind as you consider finding a troupe is that all other songwriters need your help as well. **You're not the only one who has this problem!**



Alongside having a good troupe to meet with is having a mentor if you can find one. "There is wisdom in a multitude of counsel." Having a teacher to bounce ideas off of is like having a Mr. Miyagi.



Not only can your mentor give you perspective but will also give you the swift kick in the pants when you need it. Surrounding yourself with honest people will keep you from being able to lie to yourself.

One last piece of advice before you go. Sometimes it's a good idea to take a break and come back. Unless you are under a deadline to turn in your work, there's no rush.



Choosing to do nothing is still a choice. Sometimes it can be the best thing for over thinking. You will be amazed at how a little bit of rest will revive your zeal and passion for writing.



Once you are refreshed, get back to it. Get back on the horse and try again. **Don't give up.** You will eventually push through and find the right name.



If you still need help naming it, send it to me. I'd be happy to give you my opinion. I hope this has been helpful to you. If you stay after it, I promise you will be naming songs for people who get stuck. **Now go write it!**
