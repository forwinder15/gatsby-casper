excerpt: Every songwriter wants to make money doing what they love. Writing. Sometimes it's possible and sometimes it's not. So, here's the question. Would giving your songs away help get you there? That's an interesting question. My answer might surprise you.

*Should I give my songs away for free?* **Absolutely not! 1. Fair pay. You should get paid for your work. 2. Social media. Use other ways to share your music. 3. YouTube. If you amass a bunch of subscribers, you can accomplish two things at once.**

**If it's too good to be true.....**

**The problem with FREE stuff is that it is typically worth what you pay for it or didn't pay for it.** Unless you are on a website like this one where we give away tons of FREE information.

Of course, you may feel that the info I give out is worth about as much as a free football bat, but I hope that's not the case. I think you know what I mean.

I recently tried a new type of superfood powder. Not because I'm a health nut but because my spirit animal is a chubby little bear named Winnie the Pooh.

Anyways, in the jar was a "get your next one on us for FREE" card. I thought, Oh, cool. I like this company. So I waited until I was completely out like an idiot before I remember I had the card, right? Of course right.

My wife got online to check out the FREE deal only to find out that is was a 2oz sample size. Ha! That won't get me through one week. Let alone a month. The shipping made it not even worth it!

What about fortune cookies? Now there's something worth more than you pay. Not! Have you ever gotten someone else's fortune cookie? "You will have a bad day today!"

"Uh, I think this one is yours Tom. You must have mine." Tom says, "This one says...Someone else will tell you your misfortune...." FREE stuff isn't always worth the hassle, is it?

Why am I belaboring the point? Because you don't want people to have that impression about something you worked so hard on. Besides, getting paid is fair. Especially, if there is real value in your music.

Think about it logically. If the FREE stuff is worth nothing, then the stuff you actually pay for should have more value, right? Logically, it should. That's not a stretch.

Is that always the case? No, of course not. Some companies can't seem to create anything worth buying. That's not you though, is it? Your songs are worth buying, aren't they?

If you are asking if you should give them away for FREE because you don't think they are worth buying, then you shouldn't be selling them anyway. **Never put your name on a product you don't believe in.**

**Like and share our post with your friends**

**Social media is a really powerful tool for sharing your music with others.** What's really cool is that most of the folks you share with are people you typically know.

You could create a page specifically to share your music if you like or you could just do it from your personal page. **My personal preference is to have someone else manage this for me.**

Social media is excellent at the sheer amount of exposure you can get with just a few clicks of the button but you have to remember that exposure is a neutral principle. What do I mean by that?

Exposure generally equals feedback. That can be either negative or positive. You may not get any response at all. So make sure you have the stomach for that before you go that route. You will be exposing yourself to unmitigated criticism.

Especially, if you choose to manage your pages yourself. This is the biggest reason I choose to elicit help in managing social media. It's hard enough to stay inspired to write without all the trolls and haters' comments.

**Even praise can be dangerous.** You will find yourself being more and more pragmatic if you aren't careful. What that means is that you will trade being yourself for doing what works to get approval.

You might wake up later in your career to find you have no idea who you are anymore or why you even do what you do. Don't lose your identity seeking the approval of fickle people.

Be yourself, write your music, put it out there, and then forget about it. **Don't even feel pressure to respond to the comments.** They will respond to one another themselves.

You can always find someone who will help with this by the way. Some people live to be on social media. Others are really good at networking and enjoy that kind of thing. Point is, you can find help with this if you need it or want it.

**I love you tuba**

YouTube is quickly becoming the new "google". Everyone in the world is now on YouTube for some reason or another. **It is the place to be on the internet when it comes to information and entertainment.**

That can be a good and a bad thing. There are some really great resources on there as well as some really stupid people. The two idiots trying to break a dead tree trunk on a live tree at a full sprint is the latest stupidity that made me laugh.

Seriously. If Yoda and the seagulls can make it alongside Ligonier ministries, then there is room for you on YouTube. Starting a channel is as simple as one, two, three. Making videos is even easier.

People want to see authenticity so put a ton of pressure on yourself to have this elaborate production. If your songs are that great, none of that will matter. **Focus on what you are good at.**

My personal approach is making music videos that focus on my lyrics. I don't do a lot of "selfie" style music videos. The focus is the music and the message, not me.

It's far more simple to do a music video that focuses on words to me. Especially, if you have a cool app on your PC or MAC that makes movies. You can go to a cool website like [**pixabay.com**](https://pixabay.com/) to download free backgrounds.

Next, you just add your finished track and lyrics to the video, and you are done. Pretty simple stuff. Of course, this all assumes you are recording your own music or have recorded your music.

If you don't have recorded tracks yet then you need to check out my new e-book [**"Song Pro's complete guide to recording your first song from home"**](https://mysongpro.com/posts/the-ultimate-guide-to-record-your-first-song-from-home/). In this e-book, I teach you all you need to know about getting started making your own tracks.

If you aren't in a position to spend money yet, then use your voice memo or voice recorder app on your cell phone. With today's microphone technology, you can capture a pretty decent demo of your music.

Of course, it will be difficult to add accompaniment unless you have a band or know some folks who will play on your demo with you.

If you go this route, keep in mind that cell phone microphones, while better than yesteryear, are still limited as to how much frequency they can accurately capture.

Once you've got a finished track to work with, putting a video together is pretty simple, as I said earlier. After you've uploaded your video, you can start sharing on your social media.

It's best to get on a "release schedule" for your YouTube channel. What that means is to simply pick one day a week where you release one new video. So, 52 videos a year. If you write as much as me, that's doable.

If you miss a week, don't kill yourself. We aren't talking that kind of rigidity. It's more about the day you release than how often. You may decide you can only do two videos a month.

Just make sure that if you pick to release on Wednesday that you release on Wednesdays. If you want to know why this works, do it first and then we will talk about it. **It just works.** Go ask any of the people with 100k subscribers.

**Bringing home the bacon**

Does this approach really work to generate an income? Sure it does. It doesn't happen overnight though. You noticed I didn't mention anything about SoundCloud, Reverbnation, or the iTunes store, didn't you?

Chances are you already know about those if you're asking about giving away your songs for free. If not, I'll cover it briefly.

Having any one of those accounts does no good if no one knows about it, right? So concentrate on generating a following first. Besides, why would I pay $0.99 for your song when I can listen for free on YouTube?

**You have to start getting real creative about how to make money with your music.** Especially, in today's age. Things are changing in the entertainment industry again. The mp3 rocked the music industry's world.

Well, I'm afraid Google and YouTube are already dealing another blow. Technology is demands change. No matter how much we hate it, it's just true. Why buy a mp3 when you can stream?

Don't get mad, adapt. Not pragmatic. We aren't changing why we do what we do or how we do it. We are simply using the mediums available to continue doing what we've always done. Write.

So, is your social media page up yet? How about your YouTube channel? Have you got any songs recorded? Well, what are you waiting for? I'm waiting. **Now go write it and share it!**
