excerpt: Every songwriter works differently. Some insist on writing music first while others prefer lyrics. I believe you should learn to do both. It's not too difficult. It just takes a willingness to learn and some effort to develop your skills. Let me show you.

*Should I write music or lyrics first?* **Yes. Learn to do both. 1. Melody. Develop a habit of creating your own melodies. 2. Poems. Treat your lyrics like writing poems. 3. Merge. Experiment with your melodies and lyrics. Try different ways of putting them together.**

## Help me to begin to begin

If you write the music first, will the song be better? Yes. If you write the lyrics first, will the song be better? Yes. Just write the song!

I think we ask these two questions because we are either really good at one and suck at the other, or we are ok at one and awesome at the other. **I'm gonna show you how to get good at both.**

The absolute hardest part of songwriting has got to be getting started. If you have written for any length of time you will agree. Sometimes you can hit the wall before you get started.

Waffling back and forth on whether to write music or lyrics first is one of the warning signs that you are stuck. Sometimes it happens out of fear that our songs are sounding too much alike.

That's one of the reasons I spend so much time coaching folks to exercise their skills daily. Every pro athlete has some sort of routine they follow. So should you.

If you want to be a great writer you need to develop a solid workout routine. [**Check out my article "5 Exercises That Will Make You Awesome"**](https://mysongpro.com/posts/5-songwriting-exercises-that-will-make-you-awesome/) for more info on how to do this.

My own personal thoughts in the past have been, "If I come up with a melody first, then the lyrics will come" or visa versa. Sometimes that works. Sometimes it doesn't and it can be frustrating when it fails.

Let's try something else that I think might help you stay busy writing and creating with better success. I want to change your approach from "either, or" to "both, and". Let me show you what I mean.

## The melody of the heart

Some people just seem to have a knack for creating melodies in their heads, man. I have seen some pretty talented writers over the years that you could give lyrics to and BAMM! They've got the tune.

How do they do this? **Practice.** Yeah, some of it is a natural bent towards making music, but they do this so much that it's become automatic. I would say creating music is their favorite part of songwriting.

Now, here's the caveat. As a result, they tend to have more musical ideas than lyrics. I would fall into this category. I struggle with lyrics sometimes, however, I can create a tune with little effort.

What happens is that those of us who make melody naturally tend to have a surplus of "un-used" ideas. That's one of the reasons we can seem to turn it on and off like a light switch. We have an archive of melodies in our heads.

Not everyone has this problem though. Some writers tend to struggle with creating melodies. They can write lyrics like nobody's business, but they are at a loss when it comes to music. Especially, if they don't play and instrument.

So, how can you be as good at creating melodies as those who are naturals? Practice. Yikes! There's that word again. What can I say? It's really that simple. So how do you practice?

Well, here are some ways that I think will help you:

-   **Learn an instrument** - this will super-charge your creativity. As you learn to play, new melodies will come to you.

-   **Spend more time playing** - If you do play, then play more than you write. You are a natural at lyrics, so develop the skill you aren't a natural at.

-   **Hum, whistle, and sing to yourself** - "Sing to yourselves in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, making melody to the Lord." You were made to make music, so make it any way you can.

I assure you, that if you do these three things regularly, you will get better at developing melodies. **Also, don't forget the power of listening to other people's music for ideas.**

## To write or not to write?

Now, there are those writers who seem to never be at a loss for good lyrics. A gentleman and fellow writer that I work with, named Steve, is like this.

I've met many writers in my day that are gifted at writing lyrics, but Steve just has a natural bent for lyrics and poetry. **This is a talent a lot of writers wish they had.**

Well, you can have it. How? **Practice.** Ok look, you gotta stop cringing every time I use that word. If you want to get better, you have to make this a part of your exercise routine.

So, what is it that makes people like Steve so good at writing lyrics? Knowledge, wisdom, and a command of the English language. Beyond that, it's practice. They do it naturally because they do it all the time.

It's like leaving your bike out in the rain over the winter as a kid. It's a pain getting it greased back up so you can ride it again. However, with a bit of patience and persistence, you're back on it in no time.

So, how can you get better at writing lyrics? Well, there are a few things that you can throw into your routine to make the words start to come a little easier. Here are a few:

-   **Read** - Oh man! Did I just give you some homework? Yes, I did. If you want to grow your knowledge, you have to read.

-   **Dictionary** - Get a dictionary and learn new words. You may even check the meaning of words you've used that "do not mean what you think it means."

-   **Write more than you play** - If you're a natural at melodies then you need to spend more time writing. Get a journal and start jotting down your feelings and ideas. Seriously. Do this!

If you spend some time learning new ways to put together phrases, you will get better at writing lyrics. **Also, read quotes and jokes that use puns.**

You'd be surprised to know that a good pun can be the backbone of a great song if you use it well. Don't be afraid to explore new ways of writing lyrics.

## Music and lyrics are good bedfellows

When you get caught in the fight between music and lyrics, it can be tough to know which side you're on. I say stop the war! "Come on people now. Smile on your brother. Everybody get together. We gotta love one another right now."

Pardon my cheesy jokes. Learning how to layer music and lyrics together is like learning how to ride a bike. As you learn to balance, you will learn to peddle and visa versa. They go hand in hand.

So, what will happen is that as you grow the ability you struggle with, the ability which comes naturally will automatically kick in. Something I haven't mentioned is that inspiration often follows learning.

As you learn to develop melodies, your natural ability to write lyrics will join in the fun with little effort. Same with lyrics. As you get better at writing lyrics your natural ability to make music will join the jam session.

**Music and lyrics go together like peanut butter and jelly.** If you like your peanut butter on top, then flip the sandwich over. The same goes for those of you who like your jelly on top.

Once you've spent time developing the ability you struggle with, you will be able to approach songwriting from both angles. Hitting "the wall" won't be such a concern because you've just become a songwriting ninja.

Oh, one more thing. Make sure you are keeping track of the ideas you come up with. For instance, if you're more of a melody writer, then record your samples. If you are a lyricist, then keep a journal.

By keeping track of all your ideas, you are creating what I call a "Cheat Sheet." **This is a great secret weapon to have any time you feel you are stuck.** Simply whip out your cheat sheet and be inspired.

I have actually created a "cheat sheet" just for you if you in my article [**"Songwriting Cheat Sheet. 126 Inspiring Ideas and Prompts"** ](https://mysongpro.com/posts/songwriting-cheat-sheet-126-inspiring-ideas-and-prompts/)I hope this helps inspire you as well.

Alright. Now it's time for you to go and practice. Ugh! Aah, don't worry that word will grow on you. Especially when you write your next great song. You'll be glad you did it. **Now go write it!**
