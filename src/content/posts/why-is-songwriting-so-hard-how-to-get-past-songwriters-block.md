excerpt: I'm not sure if songwriting is hard or I just ran out of ideas. Over the last
  25 years of writing, I have gotten stuck plenty of times. Have you ever hit
  was "the wall"? Let me show you how to move it.

*Why is songwriting so hard?* **Songwriting is only as hard as you make it. #1 Basics. Make sure you are sticking to the basics. #2 Clear your head. Spend some time having fun. #3 Get a second opinion. Ask somebody else what they think. #4 Be flexible. Try something different. #5 Let it die. Don't create a frankensong just to say you won.**





# **Back to the Basics**

I would say about 50% of the time all of my problems are because I have gone off into "cloud cuckoo land". This is the place where nothing makes sense and there are no rules.





That's fun to think about but it doesn't work for songwriting. In order for you to achieve your zen in "cloud cuckoo land," you have to get rid of song structure.





By its very nature, structure is the opposite of chaos. What happens is that we get bored and want to try something new so we throw the baby out with the bathwater and "wing it".





Next thing you know we are singing, "Take these broken wings!" We've just flown off the beaten path in a noble effort to create something new. Keep your passion. Let's get back to the path.





Go back and look at the structure of what you are trying to create. Even if it follows traditional structure ask yourself if it stays true to the basics.





Are you trying to do something with a verse that would typically be done with a chorus? Are you trying to do something with a chorus that should be done with a verse?



Those sound like super stupid questions but humor me. If you go back and look at your writing and compare it to the structure of other stuff you've done you may find the problem.



Chances are you have tried to re-invent the wheel when all you need to do is paint it a different color. Now look, I'm not attacking your new idea for a song so calm down.





I merely suggested that this may not be the right song for that idea. You may be trying to put a square cog in a round hole. What will follow is hopelessness and resentment. if you aren't careful six months will go by before you write again.





Hey, it happens all the time. Even to the best writers. We get too ambitious sometimes and in an effort to prove something to ourselves we try to "make it work".



Then we end up broken-hearted when the producer or audience says it's a terrible song. So we sulk for months over a severe blow to our ego because we put so much into trying to "make it work".





Hold your head up my child and go back to the basics to figure out where you got off track. Chances are you might just find your problem. Trust me.





## **Meditation is good for the brain**

This is gonna be a short section because you are already thinking too much. You are stressed out and frustrated with the whole "songwriting thing". The problem is you can't turn it off.





It's time to do something else. Take a break. Everyone takes a vacation from their job. Well, songwriting is work and in your case, it's "hard" work. "Take a vacation from your problems, Bob."





Baby step out the door. Baby step down the stairs. Baby step out of town. You get the idea. Have some fun and turn it off for a little while. Not forever, just take a break.



It doesn't matter what it is you do to relax as long as it's something that you enjoy very much. Immerse yourself for a little while and just "gel". Your brain will thank you.





You need to make this a regular habit in your routine. Ever so many months you need to take a break. Maybe you need to take a break more often. you must decide that for yourself.





The fact is that you are stuck now. I would wager that you were not stuck two months ago. Maybe you were. Then you've needed a break for a while now. Set a time limit and give it a try.





I am always amazed at how sharp I am when I get back from a mental vacation from songwriting. The ideas are pumping and I'm a machine. You will feel the same way. Chances are the break will break the log jam.



## **"I want a second opinion!"**

Now, here is where we can get really stubborn. We are so enamored with "making this work" that we can't see the forest for the trees.





You have got to get where you can get some perspective. Having someone else come in a listen to your song can help you in ways you didn't think possible.



Producers are an excellent second opinion if you can get your hands on one. See my article on "Songwriters vs Producers" for more info on this.



At the end of the day, you have to be willing to listen and to try out their ideas. What do you have to lose? If you don't like it then you are no worse off than you are right now, are you?





You can't afford to walk away from your gift over not being willing to try it some other way. Be thankful you have people that are willing to listen to this unfinished.......piece of...



I was just thinking of the last song I wrote that kicked my but up and down Main St. USA. Yeah, I get frustrated too. See, you are not alone. Now go find somebody who can give you feedback.



Just a side note, always thank someone for listening to your music. If it's half as bad as we think it is then they probably deserve to be paid to give us feedback, right?



## **Now you're just being stubborn**

I would say that if your blockage isn't a violation of the basics of songwriting then it's gonna be your stubbornness that's got you in the place you're in.





Pride is a good way to kill your creativity. Nobody wants to listen to a know-it-all, right? Well, how about a know-it-all songwriter? Yeah, they're the worst.



I know because I've been one. These are the ones who will argue that there is only one way to write. Come on, man. Give me a break. Only one way?



That's why there are millions of different songs out there with thousands of different formats and structures, right? Only one way to write is ridiculous.





Now, I will say your way of writing songs is the only way you should write your songs. If you keep trying to write your songs someone else's way you are doomed for total failure.



Do it your way but realize your way isn't the only way. Learn from other people so you can get unstuck don't try to copy their way of doing things.





Be yourself, just be a version of yourself that is humble and willing to learn from other people. Nobody is the end-all-be-all of anything and everyone has something they could learn to do better.





And don't be a stubborn mule. Unless you enjoy eating briars and being a thorn in the side of everyone you work with. Nobody wants to work with a know-it-all jackass.



## **"It's alive! It's alive.....wait....it's dead"**

Sometimes you have to call in the coroner and have him pronounce the song dead at the scene. If you don't you are likely to commit and suicide or a homicide.





Just have the funeral and grieve the loss. It's not worth losing your sanity over something that probably isn't as good as you think it is anyways.





Now, this is a tough balancing act because the last thing I want you to do is giving up. We don't look at someone who is having a heart attack and say, "Oh well, he's as good as dead" and then walk away. Come on.





Protect the sanctity of life here. At least try to save the life of your song. Try the few things I have given you to try. Push yourself a little.



Here is a good test of whether it's time to let go. Have you cried over yet? Most people who bury loved ones have done most of their grieving before the funeral.





If you haven't grieved it then you still have some fight left in you. If you cried over this broken idea months ago then call up the parlor before the body starts stinking.



Some people are big believers in keeping ALL their ideas no matter how bad they are. I don't agree with this and I know some of you are going to disagree with me on this.



All I can say is to trust my 25 years of experience. If you keep going back and trying to resurrect these old broken ideas you are eventually going to bring a frankensong to life.





Next thing you know you will be a raving madman claiming you have achieved the pinnacle of songwriting science and trying to convince the world that your creation is "alive!"



The biggest reason I argue from this place is because of something very basic. Life changes and we change with it. Chances are you aren't where you were when you wrote that old song.



In some cases, you may have a better perspective on your feelings now as opposed to "back when a hoe was a hoe" but it's time-consuming.





Most likely you are gonna have to take the song completely apart and stitch it back together in very weird places and it's gonna be frankensong. I'm telling you right now. Listen to me.





If you want to write a song about your past, do it. Sit down and start fresh. Do it from your perspective now. it will be awesome. However, let the past die.



Don't go grave digging. You and everyone else will regret it. It's really a big waste of time because chances are you are gonna get stuck just like last time. have the funeral and move on.





You can visit the graves every once in a while to pay your respects but like Bob Seger so eloquently put it, "turn the page". With that, we are done.





Did any of this help you at all? I hope it did because I'm sitting here waiting for you to get un-stuck so I can listen to your new song. Now go write it!
