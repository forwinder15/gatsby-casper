excerpt: I remember the first song I ever wrote believe or not. It would probably make
  you laugh if I sang it to you. As a new songwriter, my first few years were
  pretty bumpy.
---

That was way back before the world wide web existed so you couldn't just pop online and ask a guy like me to help out. Well, now you can. I have put this list together for you so you can get off to a great start.

## Tip 1. Finish the song!

If you have read anything I have put on this site for you then you probably know how I feel about this by now. I'm gonna say it again.An unfinished song is not a song, its poetry.



As a new writer, you have an excellent opportunity to cultivate this habit early on. I can't tell you how many writers I have met that have been writing for years but when you open their notebooks all you see is unfinished songs.



That is so sad. Especially when they have 20 years' worth of unfinished work! Listen to me.Finish your songs.The more you do this the better you will get at it and the less you will get stuck. The opposite will happen if you don't.



One great way to get caught up on any unfinished work is to pair it up to new ideas. For every new song you come up with, make yourself go back and finish another. It will help you.

## Tip 2. WRITE IT DOWN!

I had to learn this one the hard way. It's something I have always regretted. There is no telling how many songs I have lost because I didn't take the time to write them down.



When you are young and invincible you think your memory will not fade. Trust me when I say this, that it will. If you write as much as I used to back when I first started then you will find out sooner rather than later.



Don't be stubborn in this. You never know when you may need to pull a song from the archives. I remember one time I was asked if I had any songs about a particular subject and I had to put my head down and say, "I used to."



Trust me when I say, other people don't quite understand how a "songwriter" can forget their own work.If you want to be taken seriously, write it down.I think that's right. I can't remember.

## Tip 3. Share your work

One thing I see a lot of in young songwriters is the fear of sharing their work. I have met several writers who have actually been writing for a while that have never told anyone they write songs. Ever!



You are not bragging so let me remove that excuse. I'll go one further and say that God gave you that gift to share with other people.Our gifts are never just for us."Love your neighbor as yourself", remember



I want to ask you a question. I mean this as kindly as I know how. If you are just getting started as a writer what basis do you have for determining that your stuff is not good enough to share?



I ask because that is generally the next excuse. "My stuff isn't good enough." Whatever! Let a seasoned veteran or two, like myself, help you work out the rough spots. I bet your stuff is awesome.Share it!

## Tip 4. Listen to advice

Listening is not agreeing but you still need to listen.Just because you may not like the idea you are getting for the song you are working on now doesn't mean it is not a good idea. You may use it another time.



If you start closing your ears to others right now while you are just getting started, I'm afraid you will become one of those know-it-all troubadours later on.Be the type of writer who is open to criticism as well as encouragement.



One of these days you are going to get stuck and one of the best things for hitting "the wall" is working with other writers. If you alienate yourself by being a jerk you may not have anyone who wants to work with you.



Don't be dogmatic dog. There are a thousand different ways to write a song which means there is more than one way to do things besides the way you've been doing them. Listen.

## Tip 5. Learn an instrument

Have you already learned an instrument? Good. Learn another. Picking up a new skill will only help you as a writer. It will breed creativity and inspiration.



For those who are skeptical, don't underestimate the power of knowing how to play what you hear in your head. It is a powerful combination for a songwriter. You don't have to be a prodigy like Eddy Van Halen to learn either.



Just start learning.If you love writing and want to get better, you will make time for this. There's no excuse in today's world with all of the free instruction online why you can't do this.



Pick something practical as well. Don't start with the Oboe. You're gonna look real funny trying to sing and play the oboe at the same time. As a matter of fact, if you figure that one out let me know I want to come to watch you perform.



Guitar or piano is where I tell all of my students to start. It doesn't take much instruction before you are playing your own music.Learn an instrument. You won't regret it.

## Tip 6. Listen to your favorites

One thing that took me a long time to figure out was that I didn't have to re-invent the wheel to be a good writer.You have some of the best writers in the world right at your fingertips.



You likely have some of them right on your phone. Listen to your favorite music. As you learn more about structure and melody you will begin to hear it in the songs you love.



Now, let me warn you that this may change the way you hear music for the rest of your life. If you cultivate the skill of dissecting other artist's songs you will become a phenomenal writer but I'm afraid it's all you'll hear when you listen to music.



However, if you love writing as much as I do, then you know it's a good trade-off. Learning from others is one best ways to hone your craft over the years.Don't be too stubborn to let the greats teach you.

## Tip 7. Record your songs

This is something I wish I had started earlier on in my career. When you record your music you give your work the best chance for survival. You can save those files to your computer or hard drive and they will last a lifetime.



Writing things down is certainly a powerful way to keep track of your work but nothing is quite like recording your songs as you originally wrote them or heard them in your head.This is something I would start doing right now if I were you.Even if it's just talking into a voice recorder.



You can venture out into getting some more equipment as your skill grows with time. Eventually, I want you to have a small inexpensive home studio where you can create demos of your work.



That will put you in the driver's seat if you ever decide to create an EP. That EP will be a very powerful tool in helping you share your music with a broader audience which will give you a sense of accomplishment.

## Tip 8. Be yourself

This is something I have harped on several times before but I want to say again directly to you as a young songwriter.Find your identity early on and stick to that.If not, you could lose your way.



I told you earlier to listen to your favorites, right? Well, that will likely be the genre or style of writing that you are good at. It's great to learn new styles and definitely something to pursue just don't forget who you are.



There have been several famous artists out there who have tried to venture away from who they were and have lived to regret it.Your most powerful work will always be where your passion is and passion never strays too far from home.

## Tip 9. Embrace failure

I don't think there is a way to break this to you gently. Failure is inevitable. You are going to have that one song that is going to beat you.Get ready for it and get over it.



It will seem that no matter what you do you just can't seem to get that song to work. If you aren't careful it will drive you insane. You have to learn to accept defeat and move on. Don't cry about it for years.It's just a song.



Don't worry, you are not alone. We have all had the same thing happen to us. It's one of those lessons you just have to learn on your own. Having a group of writers that you can lean on will greatly help you to grieve it and move on.

## Tip 10. Let it die

So here is what happens when you don't embrace failure and accept that the song you wrote won't work. You will tuck it away for a little while until you get the urge to tackle it again.



Keep in mind, this thing didn't work the last time you tried and you literally tried everything. Now, this is where you will start getting crazy. You'll be frantically moving stuff around and stitching things together that don't belong.....



Next thing you know you'll hear yourself scream, "It's alive!" You have just created "Frankensong". That won't be good enough though. Next, you will unleash your"Frankensong"on to the world convinced it's for the good of the people.



Let it die, grieve the loss, and move on.You don't want people running in fear every time you come around because you desperately want people to say your ugly baby is beautiful. Don't be a mad scientist. Let it die.

## Tip 11. Form a troupe

As your teacher, my advice is to go out right now and find other writers that you can meet with regularly. Don't worry if you write different genres from one another. That's a good thing.



You will find yourself picking up skills that you would not have learned otherwise and you will be an encouragement to the others.A songwriting troupe will keep you pumped and cultivate creativity.



In my opinion, a troupe is the greatest deterrent for making mistakes as well. You are likely to get some pretty harsh feedback from your troupe when you start doing crazy stuff with your work. That will keep you honest and humble.



We all need that kind of accountability.As time goes on you will grow very close to the writers you work with. It's my hope that you will collaborate and create songs that change people's lives for the better.

## Tip 12. Buy quality not quantity

Have you ever met that person who has 20 instruments that are all junk? Yeah, don't be this person. I'm happy for the people who have one of every instrument known to man but junk instruments are wall ornaments to me.



If you spend more time trying to keep the thing in tune than you do playing it then it's not worth the money you spent. The same goes for other types of equipment. Microphones are a biggie.Just do your research before you buy.



There are way too many reviews out there on the internet for you to be making uninformed decisions. Don't go to Guitar Center and suddenly become stupid drunk by all the stuff they have in the store either.



And for goodness sake, don't let the kids in pro-audio tell you what kind of equipment you "need". They didn't suddenly become experts because somebody gave them a shirt with a GC logo and paid them to stand around giving their opinions.



Now look, some of the folks in these stores do know their stuff but the only reason you should be at a music store in the first place is to check out what you've already researched.Do this and you will be a happier camper.

## Tip 13. Hum, humdinger

You will discover in your writing career that melodies can be elusive. One way to combat that is to hum to yourself. Don't just hum familiar tunes but make things up.Be original.



"Sing to yourselves in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs making melody in your hearts to the Lord." This is an excellent practice and one that has helped me develop my craft.



Cultivating this habit will also help to make sure you don't get stuck as often.One thing writers complain a lot about is hitting "the wall" or "writer's block". When I hear this, I always wonder to myself if they are humming on a regular basis.



Writing a great melody is as important as structure or lyrics. In some cases, it will outpace even the dumbest lyrics. If you think this practice is trivial, I encourage you to try it. It will help you.

## Tip 14. Write, write, write

Is your new song finished yet? Yes? Write again. Don't let the grass grow under your feet waiting to share your new stuff.Just keep writing.Opportunities to share will come.



It's like working out a muscle. The more you use it the stronger it will get. That seems pretty obvious but I can't tell you how many times in my early career that I went months without writing. I wonder how many great songs I would have now?



Keep going. Sometimes you will have a song that isn't really working. If you keep writing you may come up with an idea that goes with your "trouble" song like peanuts and butter. What you'll end up with is one really good song.



This won't happen if you don't keep writing. There is a delicate balance between finishing your songs and continuing to write but I'm sure you find that balance. Don't stop. Keep writing.

## Tip 15. From the heart

Some call it, **"writing from the pain".** Whatever you want to call it, find it and write from there.This is where you will do your very best work.



The beautiful thing about writing from the heart is that you don't have to fake it. The most powerful things in our lives are the things we have lived through or are living through right now.



If you want to move people to tears and change their lives then do what I'm telling you. People long to be able to relate to others and you will build a super-strong connection being genuine.



Check out my article ["How to write a song from the heart”](/posts/i-cried-dude-how-to-write-a-song-from-the-heart/) for more info on this.



Don't be a fake. Believe in your message and write it like you mean it. This takes extraordinary courage but you can do it.I believe in you. **Now go write it!**
