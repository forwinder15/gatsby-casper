_How do I write an awesome chorus?_ **Create a catchy melody and good lyrics that cause people to want to hear the rest of the song. 1. Melody. Create the best melody you can for your lyrics. 2. Mystery. Don't give away your entire message in the chorus. 3. Play on words. Use quotes, puns, and figures of speech. 4. Syllable perfection. Make sure the syllable count is right. 5. Keep it simple. Find the most powerful way to write using the fewest words possible. 6. Harmony. The message of your song must be resolved by your chorus. 7. Repetition. Find the perfect balance for your song. 8. Field test. Try your chorus out on people and record the feedback. 9. Method. Use different strategies to write your chorus. 10. Collaboration. Find another writer who can help you. 11. Try again. The more you write the better you will get.**

**We all have that song that we hate getting stuck in our heads. If you are like me, then you have several songs that you despise getting trapped between your ears.**

- "This is the song that never ends..."
- "I just can't getcha out of my head..."
- "I came in like a wrecking ball..."

I mean no offense if you like any of these songs. Don't get too worked up because each one of those got stuck in my head while I was trying to write this!

Whether we want to admit it or not, the songs we despise have very well written choruses. The catchy melody itself enough to get lodged in your brain for a good while.

Next thing you know you'll be tapping your foot to the tune trying to force yourself not to sing the lyrics under your breath. So annoying.

This is the principle behind selling millions of records and downloads. But like I've told you before, I don't want you getting caught in that rat wheel. It will rob you of your passion.

I want you to sell three hundred million copies of your song. Don't get me wrong. I just don't want that to become the "reason" that you write. Does that make sense?

Now, we can use the "principle" behind selling records to structure our own songs. Because let's face it, we all want people to hear our work. The catchier it is the more likely they will listen.

What I do not want happening is for your heart to change or your motive to get polluted by dollar signs. I want you to stay in love with songwriting. **I want you to change people's lives for the better with your music.**

You can do both, by the way. You can write great songs that get stuck in people's heads and change their lives at the same time. You can also make a little money while doing this.

Just don't let money be the driving force behind why you write. It will steal your passion as a songwriter in the long run. **We simply need to keep our balance.**

As I said, there's nothing wrong with learning the tricks of the trade. We just want to make sure we find our balance between being an artist and being a professional.

All right. I'm off my soapbox now. Let's get to learning how to write a great chorus that tells your story and gets stuck in people's heads.

## **1. “Do a deer, a female deer”**

I've seen so many songwriters try to tack on the melody "after" the song was completed. I just smack myself in the face and shake my head.

Why would you spend the least amount of time on the most important thing? A great melody can outpace the dumbest lyrics. You know that. The three songs I listed earlier are proof of that fact!

"Well, I don't play and instrument." You can hum and whistle can't you? What the crap? Really? Come on, guys. Try a little harder than this.**Don't let someone else do your work for you.**

The melody is half of the song. This is where you need to start in my opinion. Not "tack on" to your "awesome lyrics". Begin with a catchy tune and see how that changes your whole approach.

Now look, I know everyone works differently but this is a "no-go". You have to learn to create your own melodies. Making them up in your headcounts. **You don't have to be able to write music to do this.**

Beethoven, Mozart, and Bach all made their music up in their head. You have zero excuses here. If you will take time to create a catchy melody you may be surprised how easily the lyrics fit into that melody.

I'll go one further and suggest you start with the melody of the chorus. **Begin with the heart of your song and work your way out.** You will get stuck less often and your melody will guide you the whole way. I’ll touch on this more later.

## **2. Don't "Just give it away"**

Have you ever found yourself caught up in the story of a TV series like "Downton Abbey" or "The Chosen"? No matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to keep yourself from watching the next episode.

**Next thing you know, you've been sitting on the couch for three weeks in the same pajamas and you smell like a bag of butt holes.** You finished the series though, didn't you?

It's a lot like finishing. For whatever reason, a fish will get caught over and over because it can't keep itself from "taking the bait". We are much the same.

The producers, writers, and directors dangle that "lure" in front of us right at the end of each episode and we can't help ourselves. "Next episode begins in 7, 6, 5, 4...", you know the drill.

What you get caught up in is the "mystery" of the unknown. The unfinished story. There is just enough information left out to keep you wanting more. A great chorus does the same thing on a slightly smaller scale.

**What you want to do is give folks a piece of the puzzle.** The most interesting piece you can give them without giving away the whole story.

We want to pique their interest enough to motivate them to listen to the whole song. Once they've heard it, you want them to have that same sense of satisfaction I mentioned earlier.

That feeling of achievement you get from learning you set out to discover. If you've done your work well, they will feel their life has been made better by your song and will want to experience that feeling again and again.

## **3. That chorus is so catchy!**

So, I told you earlier that a great melody can outpace stupid lyrics, right? Well, what do you think happens when your lyrics are as catchy as your melody? I think you know the answer.

Some of the best songs ever written are the ones that have a great melody accompanied by a great "play on words". It's the most powerful combination in songwriting.

There are three really great ways to go about using "play on words" to achieve great lyrics in your chorus. Here they are:

1. **Quotes** - I've brought quotes up in other posts. Using quotes is like having Biff's "sports almanac" from Back to the Future 2. If a quote is too long, simply summarize it in your own words. You must try this.
2. **Puns** - Not only will good puns add an element of humor to your song but using them will make your chorus more engaging. Puns help create a layer of mystery by causing the listener to think a little deeper about your meaning.

3. **Figures of speech** - Many songs have been written based on a figure of speech. I'd bet you could think of a few right now if I asked you to. Figures of speech will give your song a sense of familiarity. If you're clever you can play around with old figures of speech and create something fresh.

I want to issue a challenge to you. See if you can get all three of these into the same song. The more fun your lyrics are the easier it will be for the audience to latch on.

## **4. Syl...la...bles**

If you are going for catchy then you have to make it easy to remember. The harder it is to sing the harder it will be to remember. "I still haven't found what I'm looking for". **Easy to remember and it begs you to listen to the rest.**

Ok, you gotta stop singing if we are going to continue. I want you to take a really catchy song, one you love preferably, and I want you to dissect the lyrics. Sit down and count the syllables.

"Oh wow, that sounds boring!" you say? "Do it!, and let the English see you do it!" says I. This will help you tremendously. **I want you to learn from a successful pattern.**

I'm not going to give you my lyrics because you need to write your own from your own style of music. **That means you need to be learning from the songwriters that you love to listen to.**

Watch what they have done with the lyrics of your favorite songs. Count the syllables and notice what they did with the English vocabulary to make their song flow seamlessly from start to finish.

Trust me. This is one of the reasons you kept re-playing your favorite song all those times. A song with syllable problems is near impossible to listen to once. Let alone fifty times.

Work at this. You don't have to make everything match exactly if you chose not to but the easier it is to sing the catchier it will be.

## **5. Keep it simple stupid (KISS)**

I've preached about this till I'm blue in the face. You can't treat songwriting like a therapy session all the time. Your audience may end up needing therapy if you aren't careful.

I think you know what I mean. If not, I'll explain. You have heard those songs, or maybe even written a few, that give way to many details. I mean seriously, TMI!

**Some things should stay between you and God and the fence post.** We definitely want to be as relatable as possible but you have to be careful not to go too far.

If you aren't careful you'll get done and your audience will be looking at you like you have lobsters coming out of your ears. I can say this because it's happened to me.

The other thing you have to be careful of is the sheer amount of emotional impact your words are having. If you give too much information about your life the audience may die of "blunt force trauma".

Remember the attention span and absorption rate of your audience. They are only going to be able to absorb, at max, one or two plots within your song. The music is a plot of its own.

Three plots in three and a half minutes is a high bar for the average person. Keep that in mind when you are writing. Summarize. Use the fewest words possible that have the greatest impact.

Don't be too abstract either. **Get to the point, stick to the point, and make it a point to "say what you mean to say".** If you start chasing rabbits, I'm going back in my tortoiseshell.

## **6. Resolving resolution**

The last thing you want to do is take your audience on a wild ride with no way for them to get off. Your chorus should provide that safe place where everything comes together.

Just like fishing, you want to set the hook with the intention of letting your fish go so you can catch him again and again. **If your hook hurts the fish he won't bite again.** If you've never fished I apologize.

Essentially, you have to have good intentions towards your audience. You want them to listen more than once, right? So don't ram your message down their throat.

Your chorus needs to resolve any conflict you create with your verses or bridge. A great chorus is written in such a way that it does just that. You must be gentle and intentional.

If you take my advice from earlier and build the song starting with the chorus and work outward this will be easier to accomplish. Your verses will become natural extensions of the theme of your chorus.

You want your verses to create a sense of "incompleteness" that your chorus can come along and resolve. **If you do this right, your audience will attach their own story to your chorus as they listen over and over.**

## **7. Just enough times**

**Get this right and people won't stop playing your song.** Most peeps in the industry will tell you that the average life span of a song is around three and a half minutes.

It's about the maximum time you have to get your audience engaged in your song. Now, we all know and love songs that are over three and a half minutes. Why?

Because there was just enough to keep us coming back for more. The right number of lyrics and the right amount of music in just the right places.

**This is more of an art than it is a science.** What you have to figure out with each and every song you write is "where's the sweet spot?"

Don't even think I can tell you exactly where it is. If I knew that I would be famous. Every songwriter has to figure this out for themselves.

It goes back to what I said in the opener about finding a balance between art and profession. You want the song to sell but you also want it to be genuine.

Build the song in the way it "feels" the most natural and then listen back. Pay attention to your emotions as you listen. You want to feel exhilarated not exhausted.

That's a delicate balance. It takes everything into account. Especially your chorus melody, lyrics, and repetition.**Play with your recipes till you get them just right.**

## **8. I want a second opinion!**

This is the most powerful tool in your box for achieving balance in your song. Let people listen to it. Pay attention to what they say and how they feel.

You might even come up with a little questionnaire that you walk people through. Whatever it takes to get honest feedback is what you have to do.

This may take some doing and searching. Some people either aren't as honest as you may want them to be or they don't know how to express their feelings at all.

If you have been reading my other stuff then you know I advocate for having a songwriting troupe. **That may just be the very best feedback you could possibly have.**

Now look, don't go back and reconstruct an entire song because two out of five people didn't like it. Take their feedback and see if there is a way to include it without messing up what other people loved about it.

That takes practice and wisdom so be careful. I find it very helpful to examine feedback by the law of averages. I always include my own opinion as well. After all, it's my song.

An extra side note; remember that music is very subjective. What you like someone else hates and visa versa. Just keep that in mind when you consider the feedback you have gotten.

**Some people have decided not to like anything just because they are turds.**These folks aren't worth listening to. However, make sure that is actually the case. Your song may actually be the turd.

## **9. Beginning, middle, or end**

Hmm. Where to start? **The blank page can be tantalizing.** It can mock you into balking. It's a great idea to have some strategy before you try to conquer the world with your song.

There have been many times I have sat down with no idea how I was going to approach a song and got my butt handed to me. Every time this happens it can be tough to overcome.

So here is what I've done over the years to develop my method of writing. I try each and every time to come into my songwriting session with some sort of strategy.

My favorite one is "chorus melody first". **Before I allow myself to start writing any lyrics, I come up with a catchy melody for my chorus**.

I have found that if I start with the heart of the song the rest of it will fall into place as I work my way outward. Now, this isn't the only strategy.

One I used to use a lot was "sequence". Essentially, start with the first verse and march through to the end of the song. This is a difficult way to write.

**If you're not careful your first verse actually ends up being the chorus in disguise.** The song starts off great and is all downhill from there. By the end you're bored.

There are lots of different approaches and perhaps I'll write a post on all of them soon. For now, you need to find a way to strategically approach your songwriting so you don't get your butt kicked.

## **10. Please help me!**

I mentioned this a little earlier when I brought up having a songwriting troupe. Collaboration goes a step further than feedback. This is where you actually solicit the help of a fellow writer.

Does that mean you have to share the credit ad the rights? Yes, it does. But who cares? As long as the song changes people's lives for the better what difference doe that make?

The only writers who refuse to collaborate are stuff shirts that either want to find their "zen" or just make money. Find someone who shares your passion and write an amazing chorus together.

You'd be surprised at just how many of your favorite songs were co-written. **It's extremely common for writers to help one another.**Two heads are better than one, right?

Don't get butt hurt either. You aren't admitting defeat by doing this. It's actually the opposite. You realize the opportunity to help people is too great to fail by being prideful.

You and I both know that neither one of us has all the answers to our own songwriting problems. If we did you wouldn't be reading this and I wouldn't be writing it.

I still work with other people on many occasions. Here's a little tip; the person you work with doesn't even have to be a "songwriter". You'd be surprised who will help if you just ask.

Besides, think of the sheer amount of knowledge you will gain by going into someone else's world and watching them work. Mind blown! (explosion)

## **11. Get up you bum!**

It's not going to be perfect every time. So get over it. And if you've heard anything I've said, hear this. Selling records doesn't make you a great songwriter. Changing a life does.

Don't get discouraged because none of your songs seem to pass "muster" in Nashville. Who cares? Do you have an audience where you are?

Get one. Make their lives better with the music God gave you. Have fun. **Quit worrying so much about selling records.** If you hone your craft and cultivate your passion, the money will come.

Keep writing and don't ever forget why you started writing in the first place. So many writers lose their identity chasing the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.

If you aren't careful you'll get depressed and give up on writing completely. Figure out who you are right now and write from there.

The only writer who is a complete failure is the one who walked away. The one who gave up and quit. I know you aren't a quitter so keep writing.

If you write a piece of crap, so what? Write again. If you write a number one hit single, who cares? Write again. **Even if you wrote a hit song today, you're gonna have to do it again tomorrow.**

It's never enough. Consumption never stops. People are never satisfied. They always want bigger, better, faster. You got to write for another reason.

**You have to find your "pain".** Your "heart". Your "passion". Write from there and don't ever lose that. That's what jars people awake. It's what changes people's lives.

Let's hear that next killer melody idea you have. Add some lyrics and create an awesome chorus. Well? I'm waiting. Now go write it!
