excerpt: A really good happy song can affect your "mood" a lot. I know for
  myself that the chorus of "Don't worry be happy" has helped me get over
  frustration plenty of times. Writing a "happy" song isn't that difficult if
  you follow some basic steps. Let me show you.

*How do I write a happy song?* **Find a way to get happy and write from there. 1. Act happy. Develop your acting skills. 2. Reflect. Think about things that make you happy. 3. Tempo. The beat will influence your song. 4. Rhyme. Make your rhymes easy to sing. 5. Syllables. Get your syllables to match as close as possible. 6. Verbs. Use only positive action verbs. 7. The key. Using major keys will make your song sound happy.**



## **1. Force the smile**

As a songwriter, you can't always be in the exact right mood for the song you are trying to write. Especially, if you are writing as a full-time job.





Your contract, client, or customer may want a happy song from you and that's the very last thing you feel right now. You just wrecked your car, buried your dog, and found out that you need a colonoscopy.



So, what do you do?**You have to don your acting cap.**Some call this "getting into character". As a songwriter, you need to work on this skill if you intend to be a full-time writer.





Novice writers tend to allow their "mood" to guide their songwriting. They are really good at writing from the "pain" of the moment even if they don't know they are doing it.





That's an awesome thing if you are creating originals for your portfolio but sometimes as a writer, you may get paid or be asked to write something you aren't in the "mood" to write.





Learning how to "get in character" will help you write in ways that you may not "feel" like writing. You will find it useful even when you are writing for your own portfolio.



Life can happen in the middle of a project and throw your "mood" way off.**Developing this skill will help you build a resistance to the fickleness of your "mood" which will make you a better writer.**



## **2. "I miss back when"**

One of the best ways to "get in character" is to pull out a photo album full of great memories. Try to focus on the "happiness" you feel while reflecting.



Maybe it's a picture of you playing ball as a kid or a photo of your grandpa in uniform. Most of the time the picture is just a doorway to a room full of emotion.



If you can involve one of the people who are in the photos do it. If you can have that "campfire storytelling" time with them that would be awesome. Hearing their experiences will help you.





You simply want to pay very close attention to how your "feelings" shift from where you are now to being "happy". If you do this enough you will eventually be able to "get in character" on command.



Now I say that as a general rule. Sometimes I still have to sit a reflect a little while to get in the right frame of mind for the song I want to write.



I find myself doing this if I'm going through a tougher situation than normal or if I've got a lot on my mind.**Will power just isn't enough sometimes.**Even for seasoned writers.



Pull out the photo album and the memory bank if you are having a hard time making yourself smile. You will find it much easier to write with those "happy" moments fresh on your mind.



Who knows, you may get some inspiration as well. I've had many a song idea come from simply reflecting on my favorite memories in life.



## **3. What time is it?**

Timing can make or break your song's flow but in the case of changing its mood, I think that's subjective.**It really depends on what type of "happy" you are going for.**



Do you want that "what a wonderful world" kind of "happy"? Or are you after that "take these shackles off my feet so I can dance" kind of "happy"?



**There have been plenty of slow songs that make me feel "happy":**

* "L is for the way you look at me"
* "Bluebirds singing a song, nothin but bluebirds all day long"



* "Would you paint me a Birmingham?"



The list could go on and on. You may have thought of some better ones. On the other side of the coin, there have been many upbeat songs that make "happy":



* "Don't worry be happy
* "Rappers delight"
* "The hokey pokey"



Make sure you "get into character" for whatever "mood" you are trying to create. That will go a long way towards helping you decide what the tempo should be.



## **4. I see a cat with a bat. How 'bout that?**

As a good rule of thumb; perfect rhyme equals a more childish sound. The opposite is true. Imperfect rhyme equals a more grown-up sound.





**You will find it is easier to decide what the best balance of rhyme should be by determining who your target audience is before you start.**



"Skinamarinky dinky dink. Skinamarinky do" might make children very "happy" but it makes me want to change the channel. Likewise, children don't typically care for "What a wonderful world".



Now, most everybody I meet, young and old, loves "Don't worry be happy". This song is a great example of how to find the right balance of the rhyme.





This is gonna be one of those things which are trial and error. You will have to play with your lyrics until you get it just right.





## **5. Di..di..di..did you hear it?**

I've always told my students to count their syllables. You need to do this no matter what type of song you are writing. This is a basic songwriting skill.



The syllables don't have to match perfectly from line to line if you don't want them to but it will affect the flow and "feel" of your song. Just like rhyme.





**A more complex syllable structure will "feel" like a more grown-up song. Likewise, a more simple syllable structure will "feel" more childish.**





The reason that it's this way is that children's brains typically can not absorb all of the complexities that adults can. They're critical thinking skills haven't been fully developed yet.





That's why said earlier that you need to decide who your intended audience is before you start writing. That one factor will resolve a lot of your issues for you.



If it's a song geared towards children then you know you need to keep the syllable count simple and nearly perfect. For adults, you could experiment a little more.





Counting syllables is pretty straight forward. I have written an article on this skill called "5 exercises that will make you awesome" if you want more help with this.



## **6. Dancing....they're dancing!**

If you want to create positive emotions make sure you use positive verbs. Negative verbs will give your song a, guess what? A negative "feel".





Crying, divorcing, fighting, cleaning all carry a negative "feeling". Well, maybe not "cleaning" for some of you but it makes me have nightmares.



Words carry emotion with them just like the photos you used earlier to "get in character".**Every "action" word that you use will drum up some sort of "feeling" for your audience.**



You can see this happen at live events when artists sing familiar songs. It doesn't take much for the entire crowd to be hanging on every word of the performers.



The same happens on an individual level. We've all seen you singing in your car at the stoplight. Seriously, we have all had those moments where a song overwhelms us and we are bursting with emotion.





Keep this in mind when you are choosing your verbs. A well-placed word in your lyrics can be what takes your song to the next level of what you want to achieve. In this case, a "happy" feeling.





## **7. Where are my keys?**

Alright, let's wrap it up here. Choosing the right key can greatly affect the emotions of the song. Minor keys tend to be too complex and gloomy for "happy" songs.





Major keys will probably be your best bet for a "happy" song. Additionally, the notes you choose will have a great effect on the "mood" of your song.



For instance, minor notes tend to have a naturally pessimistic tone whereas major notes tend to have an optimistic tone. The tone of your song will be decided by how many of each you incorporate.



**This is sort of like syllables and tempo.**For example, you may have a song that is in the key of G, right? If you play E minor fifty times in the song, it will sound dreary even though it's a major key.



Contrariwise, if you play major chords the entire time the song may feel upbeat but will sound simpler and less complex. You will have to find out what is the right balance for the song you are writing.



Again, determining your intended audience will help guide you through this. If you want to write a "happy" song for children you may do well to compose it entirely of major notes. 



If your song is directed at adults you may be able to plug in a few minor chords along the way without impacting the overall "happy" tone of the song. Remember, balance is the key.



Well, now I'm all keyed up to hear your new song. I wonder how "happy" I will feel once I've heard it. I'm waiting. Now go write it!
