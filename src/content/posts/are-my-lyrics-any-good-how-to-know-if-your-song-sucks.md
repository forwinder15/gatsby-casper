excerpt: We all want to know if our songs suck or not, right? I still ask myself this
  after 25 years of songwriting because not everything I write can be a hit
  song. So how do you tell? I'll show you what I have learned.

*Are my lyrics any good?* **Of course, your lyrics are good. We just need to know how good. #1 Your lyrics need to make sense. We can't read your mind. #2 Your lyrics should be true to your heart. Say what you mean to say. #3 Your lyrics should be complete. Finish the song.**



# **"Wa....wa..wa.....wa..wa"**

Ball tub boy short high golf spandex bubble turd. This is code for something but we will never know. It's gotta make sense people. We can't read your mind.



One of my favorite exercises for lyrical examination is to go back to the golden days of the '50s and '60s. Some of the best songs ever written were at this time.



Now, this is my style of writing. You have to find your style of writing. Once you've done that, do what I do. Find those who are the best at it and listen.



Most lyric problems are caused by someone trying to re-invent the wheel. They try too hard to be too abstract and they end up creating something that very few people will listen to.



The thing I love about old music is that it was so relatable. They wrote about everyday life back then. They didn't try to write about things they knew nothing about.



So here are two questions to ask yourself: **Do I know what I'm talking about? & Am I being relatable?**



If you don't know what you are trying to say how am I supposed to know? Furthermore, if you don't know how to express what you want to say then you know you aren't relatable.



Unless you are gonna stop right here and write a song about not knowing how to relate to people because you don't know how to say what you want to say. It's been done.



I tell all my students the same thing: "You know exactly what you want to say. That's not the problem. You just need to figure out how to express it in a way people will listen."



A good exercise is to take your lyrics and read them out loud with no music or melody and see how they make you feel. You might even read them to someone else for feedback.



If their eyebrow hits their hairline and lobsters start crawling out of their ears then you know something is probably wrong with the lyrics you have written. 



## **Check your motive at the door**

Why are you writing these lyrics? What are you trying to tell me? Your lyrics should at least be understandable now if you've thought them through, but what are you trying to say?



What is the theme of this song? What is at the heart of your lyrics. Boil it down to one or two words for me. If you can do that, you may solve your dilemma knowing if they are good or not.



The real difference between good lyrics and bad lyrics is whether or not they are true or you are true to the heart of the song.



Even though I put motive as the second on the list this really needs to be the first thing you do. If you'll do this step first it will keep you from running into these types of issues.



If you have the superficial motive of just wanting to know if people are gonna like your song then you need to stop and find another hobby or way to make a living.



You can't live or die by the opinions of others because eventually, it will kill your spirit. You may end up dying without ever living your dream of writing.



People are harsh, man. That's why doing reviews on products has taken off like a rocket as a source of income. People love to criticize things.



It's hard to stomach repetitive rejection over and over again. **You have to find a different reason to do this.** You have to find a better metric for success other than the fickle opinion of the masses.



They will love you one day and spit you out the next. I don't want that to happen to you. I've been there and I will tell you that it will cause you to question writing altogether.



You have to write for the love of writing. You have to stay true to your message and your heart. That is what you will be the best at anyways. Nobody can write your songs the way you can.



Other people can give you a great outside perspective so you can see if you are making sense but don't let their perspective replace your voice.



We just want to make sure we are speaking English in a way other people can understand what we are saying. We don't want to try and write a song in another language we don't speak.



You gotta be genuine if you want to touch people's hearts with your songs. Folks are very guarded emotionally. **The only thing that penetrates is the truth.**



It's a very weird balancing act. You have to care enough that you want to touch people and you can listen to feedback but yet you have to be impervious enough to not let the haters bring you down.



If you can get here, then you have arrived. You have become an artist. Someone who creates for the love of creating. Touching lives becomes the icing on the cake.



## **Finish the song**

Nothing is worse than having a book full of unfinished songs. This is one of those things that separates the weekend tinkerer form the real songwriters.



You have to finish your songs or they are not songs. A book full of unfinished songs is poetry. Abstract poetry. Sit down and see it through to the end if you want to be taken seriously.



This takes discipline. Sometimes the chorus is the only thing written on inspiration. The rest of the song was hammered out with weeks of writing and summarizing over and over again.



Some will say this is what makes songwriting **so hard.** I say they have a weak constitution. This is what makes songwriting worth it. If it were easy anybody would do it.



It's only as hard as you make it. You just have to learn to look at things differently. Check out my article "Why is songwriting so hard?" for more info on this.



A good practice is to not allow yourself to work on more than a few songs at a time. Now, that's a fine line because inspiration is rare.



I have been struck by **inspiration in the middle** of a project so many times I can't count them all. I simply hit the pause button on the project I'm in the middle of and write the song.



I see it through to the end. This typically works. There are rare occurrences where all I can get is a chorus and nothing else. In those cases, I just make a quick audio recording of the idea and move on.



Those I will come back to once I have finished what I am working on right now. If you don't make a habit of finishing your songs you will get burned out in a hurry.



You need those wins to keep the wind in your sails. Otherwise, you'll end up stranded in the "dead sea" of ideas. You have to keep going. After all, isn't that why you love songwriting?



The struggle is all **part of the fun**. Sometimes I get a black eye but that's bragging rights. You know what I'm talking about. It's that song you tell all the other songwriters about.



"This one, man. Holy cow! This song was a beast. I thought I was never gonna finish it."



You never thought it would turn out to be your best work and everyone's favorite song, did you? Just like “you can't go if you don't start”, if you stop you don't finish.



So, now I'm sitting here waiting for you to finish all those unfinished songs you've got. I want to hear one. You never know, it might just make me cry.



**What are you waiting for?** Go read your lyrics out loud and make sure they make sense in English. If you sound like Charlie Brown's teacher, start over.



Make sure you are saying what you are saying. Why are you trying to write this song right now? Don't fake it. You're a songwriter. Act like one. Now go write it!
