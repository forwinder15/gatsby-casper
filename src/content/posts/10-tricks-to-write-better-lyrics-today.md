Nobody wants to hear that said about their song. I've learned a thing or two in 25 years of writing. Let me give you some tips that will keep you writing good lyrics.

## Does it make sense?

That seems pretty obvious but you would be surprised. Some people will ask you to sit through a song they have written and by the time it's over you feel like you’ve just gone through some type of mid-evil torture.

> You have to give people context.

Don't expect people to follow what you are trying to say if the whole blame song is one big metaphor that has no context.You have to give people context.If you are too abstract people won't be able to relate and will turn you off.

If I can't make sense of your lyrics by simply reading them aloud then something is severely wrong.The best way to combat this is to keep it simple.It's cool to use metaphors in your song just make sure they fit the message.

This is very basic stuff folks. One good practice to get into the habit of is to get a second opinion. I might suggest that you get three or four. Chances are, if four out of four people look at you like you have a tail and pitchfork then something is wrong with the lyrics.

Take their feedback. This is your audience. Hopefully, you want people to understand what it is you are trying to say to them. If they can't understand what you're saying then what's the point?

I truly hope that you are writing in large part because you want to help others.If you are doing this purely because it's therapeutic, be careful your audience doesn't need therapy by the time you're done sharing.

## Use the feedback

So, what you want to do is to learn how to hear what people are saying without letting it change who you are. Some folks go nuts when they get a little criticism.Being a people pleaser is going to drive you crazy as a writer.

Mostly, because someone is going to give you negative feedback eventually. It's one of those things that is impossible to get around. You have to learn how to process rejection in a positive way.

Measure your feedback by the law of averages. To do this you have to get more than one person's opinion and it has to be people that aren't afraid to tell you the truth. That means that your mom doesn't count.You could suck super bad and mom is gonna be proud.

One good way is to find a few people who you know are pretty critical and a few more people who aren't so critical. If you average all of those opinions against your own, you should find the answer you need to make the best decision about changing lyrics.

Then again, you may be singing about something people don't want to hear about. So keep your subject matter in mind as well.Sometimes the theme of a song can turn people off.Especially, the darker areas of life like suicide and depression.

Some people have an affinity for those types of songs. If that area is your passion then be mindful of that as you get feedback. More often than not though, I see writers question their lyrics because of how vulnerable they are being even if their lyrics are awesome.

## Be totally real

I've said this before.Be yourself.That means being real with people. Is that scary? Of course, it is. You are opening yourself to rejection in the most vulnerable way. But like I said earlier, you have to learn to deal with it.

This is especially true if you want to write great lyrics.The connection you make with your intended audience will only be as deep as you are vulnerable.As a rule, expect the audience to be about half as open to hearing you as you are willing to be heard.

I have sung my songs to some pretty tough customers in the past. I remember one particular instance I was in a music store with a friend of mine who has an extremely high standard when it comes to music.

To my surprise, I was playing a new song I had written for him when about halfway through I looked up to see him crying like a baby. It was an awesome feeling. I touched his heart without meaning to just by being genuine in my writing.

If you are willing to risk it you may find even the hardest hearts weeping as you bare your soul to them.That's what we are after, isn't it? Deep connection? People long to feel they are not alone even if they act like they have it all together.

You can pierce that veil if you will be real and open in your songwriting.Check out my article "How to write a song from the heart"if you want some more good tips on how to do this.

## Read quotes

Oh man, this is a good practice. Have you ever listened to how many great songs are built around an old saying or quote? "Time marches on", "Cat's in the cradle"...... Yeah, we could do that forever.

My advice is to start reading quotes today. Once you've begun this practice, see if you can find ways those quotes fit into your everyday life. You can then start to build songs around those thoughts. It's like magic.

The great thing about a quote is that you already have the idea boiled down for you in the simplest form. All that's left is to pair a good melody to that. My personal approach with quotes is to try to use them as a chorus or as an opening line in the first verse.

People naturally latch on to really easy concepts.The more repeatable it is the better.What quotes and sayings will teach you is how to turn the most complex ideas into catchy phrases that go great with a guitar riff.

My wife inspired me to think differently about quotes a long time ago and it transformed my writing. I would suggest that it will be the same for you. Some of you will be skeptical about this because you like being abstract but I encourage you to try this.

You might even listen to the great songwriters in the past 50 years and see if you can count how many of them use "sayings" or "quotes" in their lyrics.If you want some "secret sauce" here it is.Read quotes and use them in your songwriting.

## Tell a story

Don't write "Pulp Fiction" songs. What I mean is, don't put the beginning in the middle, the end at the beginning, and the middle at the end. You are not Quentin Tarantino and your audience isn't anticipating a "wild ride".

Besides, it's a song, not mystery theater. If your audience is left wondering if it was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick, something is wrong. This goes back to your song making sense.Nothing makes sense like a good simple story.

Start with the beginning. Give us a few details about where you've been. Next, tell us where you are and how that feels. Then, tell us where you are going. If you do this right, the rest of us might just come with you on your journey.

Unlike a movie, people need catharsis when they listen to music. Songs, as a general rule, should bring resolution and relaxation to people’s minds and hearts. That doesn't mean your story has to always have a happy ending.

Just don't leave your audience questioning their identity once you are done. That's very stressful and I can tell you from experience those types of songs are not always the most requested. Deeply passionate artists will disagree because they are hooked on the art form as pure expression.

Professionals will tell you to write only what sells.I want you to find balance.It's not complicated. Just tell your story. You don't want to be the abstract "Picasso" of songwriting but you also do not want to be a "cookie-cutter, same, same, same” songwriter either.

You can find your balance if you try. Selling songs is not what makes you a great songwriter. Neither is being the weirdo that is always trying to achieve their "zen" when they write.Changing hearts and lives for the better is the mark of a great songwriter.

## Words, words, words

Growing your vocabulary is one of the best things you can do to improve your lyrics.You may be saying the same things you have always said but if you can find a more interesting way you to say them you might just unlock the opportunity to write new a song.

There are a few different ways you can expand your vocabulary. One way is to read books regularly. Constantly exposing yourself to new ways of seeing things will help you when writing. You won't just learn new words but new ways of putting those words together.

Another way is to get a dictionary. I have found understanding the meanings of words to be as powerful as the words themselves. As stupid and simple as that sounds you may be surprised when you try it.You might find out like Inigo Montoya that, "I don't think means what you think it means."

Right up there with learning new ways to phrase words is learning different words altogether. A thesaurus is a great tool for this. I can't tell you how many "light bulb" moments I have had that have come from simply looking for a different word. I typically find a word that means the exact same thing to replace the one that doesn't work.

If you are stuck trying to rhyme the ending of the verses or chorus, you might try rhyming the vowel sound and not the consonants.Did a window of heaven just open up?Yeah, it did. This works and it might just fix a lot of problems for you.

If you get really good at rhyming vowel sounds you will discover that you can bend the vowels of two completely different words to make them sound the same when you're singing. It's a technique that blue-grass and country singers have used for decades.

## Focus on melody

I mentioned this earlier. A good melody will carry your lyrics. I know that you know what I am talking about. My absolute favorite example is, "Come on Barbie. Let's go party." I mean, how stupid was that song?

Yet here we are talking about it. Mostly because I brought it up, but still. It was an extremely catchy tune. That's what happens when you pair a good melody with your lyrics.

Now look, this can go too far. I don’t want to find out you just wrote the latest and greatest version of "Come on Barbie!"You definitely want substance in your lyrics.

However, if you focus as much on your melodies as you do your lyrics you will find that they will be like "Ebony and Ivory." I'm serious.This technique works so well that I teach it to all my students.

In fact, a lot of the time a lyrical problem is actually a bad melody problem. I mean that the lyrics you're using and the melody you are using are a bad fit. Hit the reset button on your melody and try something else.

You don't even have to change the notes much. Try changing the timing first. It's amazing how much the flow of the lyrics will differ from 4/4 to 6/8.

For all you smart-alecs, I'm talking about the triplet 6/8. You know, 123.. 456. In some cases simply slowing down the tempo helps as well.This technique will amaze you and might just make want to you subscribe to my monthly newsletter. Seriously, subscribe to my monthly letter. Do it now! Joking….moving on.

## Watch the syllables

I've said this till I'm blue in the face.Make sure your syllables are synonymous.If you have 8 syllables in the first sentence of verse one try to make sure you have the same structure in verse two.

You don't have to be a drill sergeant. If you get good enough at this you can actually use syllable variation to get people's attention to that part of the song.

We have an inner metronome built into us that can feel when something is off about a song. If you examine the lyrics and the melody carefully it becomes obvious it's a syllable problem.

You can't put a square peg in a round hole.I know syllable count tends to lend itself more towards a structural issue but words make up syllables. That can screw up your lyrics if you're not careful.

If you run into a lyric problem that is related to the number of syllables in your verse or chorus then try saying it differently. That's where all the other tips I've given you thus far come into play.

The more ways you learn how to say what it is you want to say the less likely it is that you are going to get stuck.It will also help to make your song flow really well. That makes it easier to listen to and easier to understand and so on and so on.

## To sum up

Have you heard that song that just has too many blessed words in it? I mean, it's like they took a novel and put it to music. It's not just the amount of words.They never say anything!

"Chick...the chine...the Chinese chicken" is an awesome song. That's not what I'm talking about. You know the writers I'm talking about. They want to tell their story so bad that they think they have to put every detail in. It’s like they have given very little thought as to what they want to say.

They will basically sit down and strum their guitar and start doing improv poetry about their life. If that's your thing, I apologize. It drives me nuts. Take some of that energy and expression and write an actual song.

Write one I will get stuck in my head for days that will make me cry. You obviously have talent. Show me.Summarizing your life into seven sentences does take extraordinary talent.Don't let anyone convince you otherwise.

This skill goes back to reading quotes. Learning to condense what you want to say down to the most powerful phrases will have your audience captivated. Not only that, but they will be begging for more.

Too many words that go nowhere leave people feeling lost once you're finished.If you've done your work then your melody has piqued their interest enough to listen. Don't vomit your whole life story on them. They'll feel violated afterward.

## "Just keep swimming"

"Just keep swimming, just keep swimming." See how powerful a good melody can be? Seriously, don't stop trying.The biggest mistake would be to give up.

We all want to do our very best work every time. Sometimes it can be disappointing. That's not a reason to give up. Failure is inevitable.What makes you a success is what you do after you fail.

> The only way to "be" a failure is to give up. 

And hey, lighten up on yourself. We are all our own worst critics. If you get lost go back to the basics. We are never too experienced to remember our roots.

Check out my article on ["15 things for new songwriters to live by" ](/posts/15-things-new-songwriters-should-live-by/)to help you remember the "best practices" of a good songwriter.

I will tell you what I have found over the years working with people. The biggest reason we get stuck is that we have ventured away from our comfort zone. So what if that isn't the case for you?

Well, you can start by going back and examining why you wanted to write your "trouble" song to begin with. You could also check out another of my articles"Why is songwriting so hard? How to get past songwriter's block."You are never stuck enough to quit.

**I believe in you and if you need help I am here for you as well.** So, I'm sitting and waiting for you to write those life-changing lyrics. I want to hear them. **Now go write them!**
